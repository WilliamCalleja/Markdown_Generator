        change along with the new wild world. Contemporary Felinids are ferocious
        predators imbued with the power of their felled prey but their familiarity
        with the Remnants make them viable domesticable animals. Out in the wilds
        Felinids have developed new survival strategies that capitalize on their
        powerful and dexterous bodies along with camouflage mutations.

        combat dice roll against a difficulty of 6 in order to throw and hook the
        grapple correctly against a safe landing. Once hooked the rope reduces the
        amount of movement points spent on every 1m of climbing by 1 (minimum 1).

        roll against a difficulty of 6 in order to throw and hook the grapple correctly
        against a safe landing. Once hooked the rope reduces the amount of movement
        points spent on every 1m of climbing by 1 (minimum 1).

    Tool Kit\n\nGrandmaster tools are a higher grade than mere professional kits
    that are made with better parts, have a wider variety of bits and offer the wielder
    a vast range of possibilities. A character wielding a set of grandmaster tools
    gains a boost on any related dice roll. The same categories as Professional tool
    kits is available for Grandmaster ones with the following additions:\n\n- **Wayfaring
    Kit -** Often containing sextants, telescopes, compasses, whistles and updated
    maps these kits also allow the user to quickly modify and update their maps and
    plot out long routes. Characters using wayfaring kits gain a boost to any navigation
    related dice roll.\n- **Surgeon\u2019s Tools -** A collection of blades, saws,

    roll.\n- **Trapper\u2019s Kit -** This kit is made out of a number of small snares
    and traps designed to entangle and entrap small game. The Snares are reusable

    small creatures effectively. Characters that use this kit gain a boost on their
    small game hunting action dice rolls.\n- **Herbalist's Sickles -** This set of
    sharp gardening blades allows an adept herbalist at extracting and stripping
    plants efficiently granting them with a boost on dice rolls performed to gather
    components.\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n### Grapple Hook and Rope\n\nA well honed hook and
    rope can turn an impossible or dangerous climb into a fairly reasonable task,
    as long as you can hook the grapple correctly to somewhere safe. A character
    must pass an athletics or ranged combat dice roll against a difficulty of 6 in
    order to throw and hook the grapple correctly against a safe landing. Once hooked
    the rope reduces the amount of movement points spent on every 1m of climbing
    by 1 (minimum 1).\n\n\n\n### Big Game Trap \n\nThis large heavy metal trap is
    designed to not only injure a creature but also hamstring it. Creatures that
    fall afoul of this trap suffer from a damage 4 attack that hits with a margin
    of 0. If the attack injures the target, in addition to the wound the target is
    also tangled.\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Component Canister\n\nThis pressurised vessel is
    designed to keep the unstable reactive materials that are mixed into solutions,
    safe and stable until use. A canister can store up to 10 components for 1 month
    before they decay.\n\n\n\n### Pressure Cooker\n\nThis fully sealed hyperbaric
    chamber allows a herbalist to swiftly mix up concoctions within a high pressure
    environment. This tool allows the brewer to craft solutions in 5 minutes.\n\n=\n\n\n\n####
    Armour\n\nCharacters can wear suits of armour to protect themselves from harm
    during hostile situations. \n\n\n### Armour Value (ARM)\nWhenever a character
    suffers from any damage the armour\u2019s ARM value comes into play by adding
    to the Soak to reduce the damage.\n\n### Durability Value (DUR)\nWhen a character
    is hit with a wound they have the option to take the damage on their equipment
    instead of on their body. Every armour has a Durability (DUR) value which determines
    how many wounds worth of damage the armour can take for their wearer. DUR is
    restored through a repair action, with one repair action restoring one DUR.\n\n\n\nName

    can wear gear items in order to bolster their carrying capacity or gain different
    effects. Every gear item occupies a \u2018slot\u2019 on the character\u2019s
    body and a character can only ever benefit from one item on any given slot.\n\nName

    items offer short temporary boosts, or useful cures from a number of ailments.
    Because a lot of alchemical solutions tend to be dangerous if taken without moderation,
    some items increase toxicity in a character\u2019s body.\n\n- **Toxicity -**
    A character that consumes solutions suffers from a number of toxicity points
    for each solution consumed. If a character\u2019s toxicity value is equal to
    or greater than the character\u2019s vigour, the character falls unconscious
    until the toxicity value is reduced. A character that receives a full rest reduces
    their toxicity by 1.\n\n\nName | Toxicity | ENC | Cost | Rarity | Traits \n--

    Meal\n\nA full and heavy flavourful meal rich in fats and flavour. A character

    commonly transported in small vials or pressed into swallowable pellets. Consuming
    one such infusion slows down the spread of infection to double the normal time
    it would otherwise take to increase in intensity.\n\n\n\n### Travelling Ration\n\nCommon
    travelling rations are a collection of nuts, fruits and mushrooms that have been
    dried in order to extend their longevity. A character can survive off of one
    ration daily and a ration will keep for a whole month before going bad and becoming
    completely inedible.\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Toxin Coating\n\nToxin coatings are poured
    over weapons in order to impart harmful effects on targets. Applying a toxin
    coating on a weapon is a bonus action. A weapon that is coated with a toxin will
    impart its effect on the weapon\u2019s next attack after which the coating\u2019s
    effect is lost. A weapon can only ever have one coating on it, the last one that
    it received.  A coating has an intensity value that is used to determine how
    strong its effect is. A coating will inflict a number of toxin effects on a target
    equal to the coating\u2019s intensity value.\n\n- **Deprivation [X] -** Targets
    suffer from a penalty to initiative equal to X.\n- **Enervation [X] -** Targets
    suffer from a hindrance to all actions. If X equal to or greater than the target\u2019s
    vigour, the target suffers from a -1 penalty to all close combat damage.\n- **Paralysis
    [X] -** Targets suffer from a penalty to movement points equal to X. If X is
    equal to or greater than the target\u2019s vigour, the target is slowed. A slowed
    target must choose to not receive their movement points, bonus action or main
    action at the start of their turn.\n\n\n\n\n### Armour Coating\n\nArmour coatings
    are special oils poured and smeared over armour and gear in order to impart beneficial
    and protective effects on the wearer and the item. An armour that is coated will
    retain its beneficial effects until the effects are depleted, the item is cleaned
    or a new coating is added on top of the old one. Any item can only ever benefit
    from one coating at a time.\n\n- **Fire Retardant -** The wearer of an armour
    treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points of fire intensity that
    they receive after which the coating is removed.\n- **Anti-Freeze -** Character

    3 points of cold intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.

    wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points
    of shock intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n- **Lubricant

    points of tangle intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n-
    **Alkalene -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove
    the first 3 points of corrosion intensity that they receive after which the coating
    is removed.\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n### Reagent Salve\n\nA reagent salve is designed to
    aid the body to heal. Salves are consumed by characters as bonus action and each
    salve that a character consumes causes the character to receive 1 point of toxicity.
    An alchemist\u2019s salve has an intensity value that is used to determine how
    strong its effect is. A salve can have any one of the following effects:\n\n-
    **Coagulation [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s blood loss intensity by
    an amount equal to X\n- **Cleansing [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s
    infection intensity by an amount equal to X.\n- **Purification [X] -** Reduce
    a target character\u2019s poison intensity by an amount equal to X.\n- **Fortification
    [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s disease intensity by an amount equal
    to X.\n\n\n\n\n### Mutagenic Elixir\n\nA mutagenic elixir is a body booster that
    grants a character a temporary enhancement on their natural ability. Elixirs
    are consumed by characters as bonus actions and each elixir that a character
    consumes causes the character to receive 3 points of toxicity. An elixir\u2019s
    effect lasts until the character performs a full rest. An elixir has an intensity
    value that is used to determine how strong its effect is. An elixir can have
    any one of the following effects:\n\n- **Awareness [X] -** Character gains a
    boost to perception dice rolls and  a +10% bonus to perception range per X.\n-

    rests.\n- **Might [X] -** Character gains a number of might tokens equal to X.
    The character may spend one might token at the start of a turn in order to gain
    a +1 bonus to close combat attack damage. Any unspent might tokens are lost if
    a character rests.\n- **Endurance [X] -** Character gains a bonus to carrying
    capacity equal to X.\n- **Alertness [X] -** Character gains a bonus to initiative
    equal to X.\n- **Reinvigoration -** Character removes 1 stress.\n- **Regeneration

      is any action that requires a dice roll to determine whether or not that action
      is a success or not. In the core system a dice roll is performed by rolling
      a single ten sided die and adding a modifier on top, whether it be a bonus
      or a penalty. The final result determines whether the action is a success or
      not based on whether this value is equal to or greater than the action's difficulty
      value, which unless otherwise stated is 6 by default. \n\n\n\n## Margin \n\n-\n\nThe
      dice rolls final result minus the difficulty value equals the margin. In any
      action the higher the margin, the bigger the effect of that action\u2019s success.
      Inversely a negative margin signals a bigger failure. For example a character
      rolls a 7 against a difficulty value of 6 gains a margin of success of +1.
      A character that rolls a 3 against a difficulty value of 6 gains a margin of
      failure of -3. A margin of 0 is considered to be a nominal success, i.e. the

      innate or learned skills and equipment grant bonuses and penalties to the final
      result of a dice roll. These are collectively known as modifiers. The most
      common modifiers come from character skills which govern a character\u2019s
      expertise. A character that is trained in a particular skill receives a bonus
      to dice rolls, usually a +1 or +2. Circumstances that conspire against a character\u2019s

      An action that is boosted benefits from rolling two 10 sided dice and choosing

      10 sided dice and choosing the lowest of the two.\n\n\n### Negating Boosts\nRegardless
      of how many different sources of boosts or hindrances a dice roll can only
      ever roll two dice and choose one, never more than two. Multiple sources of
      boosts and hindrances negate each other. An action that has equal amounts of
      boosts and hindrances counts as having neither. While an action that has more
      boosts than hindrances counts as being boosted and the reverse is also true.

      in addition to the extra die the final result of the dice roll benefits from
      a +1 for every additional boos beyond the first, i.e. 3 boosts result in an
      additional die and a +2 bonus. The reverse is also true, a character performing

      When a character performs an action and the margin is less than -5 or greater

        created by the demon lords to be a highly disciplined and organised fighting
        force, the strategic boon the Hobgoblins brought to the armies of darkness
        was an often underestimated advantage. When it suddenly went missing and
        worse of all, turned in favour of the alliance of the light, the war was
        all but lost. The hobgoblins have operated as closely knit military hierarchies
        for generations, pledging loyalty to strong leaders and producing many a
        mighty tyrant of their own. When the power of the empire reached the horde
        many hobgoblin battalions recognized the strength of the imperial army. Some
        chose to fight the empire because enemies worth their strength were rare.
        Others chose to join the emperor because they could see the heartless tyrant
        at the helm of the imperial machine. When the empire fell the hobgoblins
        lay scattered and leaderless, forced to form feudal fiefdoms or integrate
        with the other races to bring their peerless warcraft to the rest of the
        remnants.

      utterly fascinated by the colours, flavours, language, customs and pure mirth
      that the catfolk possessed. Despite their relatively small numbers, after imperial
      assimilation the cultural impact that the cats had on the empire was palpable.
      In truth the catfolk were an indomitable race, one who would have gleefully
      fought the empire down to the last claw, but somehow they saw something of
      worth within the empire that a lot of them decided to join them instead of
      trying to beat them. When civilization collapsed and nature reclaimed the world,
      the catfolk were left with a bitter sweet sentiment. On the one hand the nature
      that they were born and sworn to protect was now winning. On the other their

      of the dwarven lands, the stoic and pragmatic dwarves fought valiantly against
      the inevitable. The truth however is that the same pragmatism and stoicism
      that had served the dwarven leadership for untold centuries made them pliable
      and easily swayed by the empire. The dwarves were assimilated into the old
      empire and unlike other non-human races their hard work and industriousness
      found them a perfect fit for a greedy empire who was always happy to profit

      empire lay, an empire that had long outgrown the need for their wisdom, one
      that was disinterested in hearing their warnings. They had after all abandoned

      within the wild and new world that they were experiencing became intoxicating.
      The empire offered endless food to sate their endless curiosity. When the calamity
      occurred and the gnomes found themselves unable to return to their ancestral
      homeworld, they thought little of it. Katacross was now a broken world, ever
      shifting, ever changing, tethering on the brink of utter destruction beneath

      Goblin\n\n-\n\nOut of all of the races that were assimilated by the empire,
      the goblins were those who joined the latest, largely as a fault of the empire\u2019s
      inability to understand and empathise with their idiosyncrasies. Even when
      the great chieftains of the goblin settlements finally relented to the encroachment
      of the Empire and started migrating their populations behind the mighty walls
      of the imperial cities, the \u2018civilised\u2019 goblins maintained their
      identity of chaos and unpredictability. They held their heads up high in a
      world all too happy to look down on them and carved profit for their own relentlessly
      despite being treated as second-class citizens. When the empire collapsed the

        usually be detected because their logic inherently doesn\u2019t hold water
        under careful scrutiny. More often than not a good liar will throw in a dash
        of truth, but a keen observer will know that there\u2019s more to the story

      or +2.\n\n\n\n## Intimidation\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s
      ability to instill the fear of death, injury or intense discomfort into those
      foolish enough to elicit their fury.\n\n### Coerce\n\nWhen a character uses
      their intimidation skill they are confronting a target\u2019s courage and zeal.
      Make a skill dice roll against a difficulty equal to their target\u2019s willpower.
      On a successful dice roll the target gains a number of stress points equal
      to the margin of success.\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Insight\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs
      a character\u2019s ability to read between the lines, understand the unsaid
      and perceive the hidden agendas and angles of those who interact with them
      or at least interact around them.\n\n### Discern\n\nA character can use their
      insight against a target\u2019s willpower to read their mood or detect signs
      of duplicity or equivocation. While a character cannot outright detect if someone
      is lying they can detect nervousness, fear, lust or concern when they are interacting.
      Like in persuasion a character who scored a skill dice roll result equal to
      their target\u2019s willpower gains a marginal success, benign only able to
      discern surface emotions. Scoring more than a target\u2019s willpower can give
      deeper insights such as:\n\n- **Ulterior Motives -** Characters that are eager
      to offer deals that are too good to be true or that are willing to part with
      goods and services for little in return are not always desperate and something
      else can be afoot. An insightful character can detect if perhaps there is hostile
      intention or the dishonesty on display is coming from an external source (character
      could be coerced into acting in certain ways and not of their own volition).\n\n-
      **Equivocation, Omission and Duplicity -** Lies or unlikely stories can usually
      be detected because their logic inherently doesn\u2019t hold water under careful
      scrutiny. More often than not a good liar will throw in a dash of truth, but
      a keen observer will know that there\u2019s more to the story and there is
      a difference between someone who doesn\u2019t know better and someone who doesn\u2019t
      want to share everything.\n\n- **Politics and Relationships -** Be they big
      or small the foibles of interpersonal relationships in all societal arenas
      lead individuals to behave irrationally and have less than ideal ambitions.
      An insightful character is more capable of understanding these intricacies
      based on what others say and how others act, especially in front of their peers.\n\n\n\n##
      Creativity\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a characters artistic and creative abilities,
      be they oration, singing, dancing, writing, drawing, playing musical instruments,
      preparing meals, giving speeches or any imaginable form of entertainment.\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
      Conviction\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s willingness to stick
      to their principles and hold their ground when their values are challenged.
      Characters with high conviction aren\u2019t easily swayed, corrupted or dissuaded
      from theri course of action, for good or ill.\n\n\n### Willpower\nCharacters
      have a willpower score which they use to defend against manipulation, seduction,
      coercion and corruption. A character\u2019s willpower is determined by the
      character\u2019s conviction. A character\u2019s willpower is equal to 6 + the
      character\u2019s conviction skill modifier. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Academics\n\n-\n\nThis
      skill governs a character\u2019s knowledge, learned and applied and the character\u2019s
      capability to bring the full power of said knowledge to bear.\n\n### Research\n\nCharacters
      can use their academic knowledge to produce a work, a product or research that
      is tied to their area of study. A character rolls their academics skill dice
      roll against a difficulty value of 6 and they score a number of craft points
      with their action equal to the dice roll result -5. These craft points determine
      the ultimate value of the finished product. Depending on the area of study
      different products can be produced such as:\n\n- Legal defences or cases built
      towards convicting someone. Alternatively new laws can be penned to be proposed.\n\n-
      Theological treatises and philosophies can revolutionise the interpretation
      of divine events which can spawn offshoot cults, new sects or upend whole swathes
      of faithful.\n\n- From propaganda to social engineering to simple marketing
      projects, a deep knowledge of history and society can let those in the know
      manipulate the masses.\n\n- Both foreign and domestic strategies and policies
      begin with a deep analysis of countries, nations, empires and communities.\n\n-
      Scientific theorems, patents, inventions and processes all require a deep understanding
      of the scientific and engineering concepts behind them.\n\n\n\n## Crafting\n\n-\n\nThis
      skill governs a character\u2019s ability to manufacture items with their hands,
      materials and tools. Characters with the appropriate training and equipment
      can craft any item as long as they have sufficient skill and raw materials.\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
      Spellcasting\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character's ability to turn the arcane
      and divine into a weapon, wielding the powers mystic against their foes.\n\n###
      Casting Spells\n\nSpells are actions like any other, performed during specific
      phases of play as per the spell\u2019s description. When a spell targets a
      creature, the target can choose to resist the spell\u2019s effect. If the target
      is resisting, the spellcaster must perform a spellcasting dice roll against
      a difficulty equal to the target\u2019s willpower.\n\n\n\n## Survival\n\n-\n\nThe
      survival skill is a collection of knowledge and practice that allows a character
      to navigate, traverse and understand wild environments.\n\n\n### Forage\nCharacters
      adept in the survival skill can use it to forage for food and drink to sustain
      themselves. Every forage action requires a character to perform a survival
      skill dice roll against a base difficulty of 6 (modified by terrain, weather
      conditions and scarcity). Every action consumes 2 hours of work and on a success
      it will yield 1 day\u2019s worth of rations for one person. A critical success
      yields double the amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Stealth\n\n-\n\nThe stealth skill is
      possessed by characters who are adept at blending in, be it with the shadows,
      crowds or chaos. With the stealth skill a character can pass by unseen, pilfer
      things surreptitiously or even plant dangerous items without the recipient\u2019s
      knowledge.\n\n=\n\n\n\n"

          raw materials from them. When doing so the quality of the materials deteriorates
          as a consequence of scavenging. The amount of Raw materials scavenged in
          ENC is the same as the ENC of the item but the quality of raw material
          is one rating less than the item's rarity (to a minimum of 1, Common).
          For example Scavenging a rare item of ENC 3 yields ENC 3 worth of uncommon
          materials.)

          all examples of types. The rarity level needs to match the rarity of the
          item being created. For example a Longsword is an Uncommon Metal Weapon
          with an ENC of 1 so a crafter needs 1 ENC of Uncommon Metal in order to
          craft it.
        - Performing repairs and upgrades also need raw materials, just less of them.

      to treat wounds and can do so once per long rest. Even if an infection isn\u2019t
      removed, if the wounds are treated the infection\u2019s spread slows down to

      Round\n-\n###Survival Skill vs Difficulty 6\nCharacters that successfully locate
      the presence of a creature can choose to pursue it by tracking it down to where
      it currently resides. A character performs a survival skill dice roll against
      a difficulty of 6 to gain a number of tracking points equal to the margin of
      success of the dice roll. They may spend these tracking points to determine
      one or more of the following:\n- The route to take to reach the creature\n-
      The approximate distance that there currently is between them and the creature\n-
      The current behaviour of the creature (seeking food, seeking shelter, etc...)\n-
      The current status of the creature (recently fed, tired, seeking mate, etc...)\n\nOnce
      a character reaches such a creature, normal combat is used to determine the
      outcome of the hunt.\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Taming & Training\n\n-\n\nThe taming

      join them in their travels and perform tasks for them. A well trained pet can
      be invaluable in most situations.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Tame\n##5 Minutes\n-\n###Survival

      approaching it and attempting to befriend it. This is of course dangerous in
      the best of circumstances and a character that fails in their attempt is probably
      going ot be faced with an ornery wild animal. On a successful dice roll a character
      manages to befriend the animal get it to trust and follow them but the animal
      is not yet trained. The following is a list of modifiers that can apply for
      the taming action:\n- **Food Offering -** Gain a +1 bonus on this dice roll
      if you bring food for the animal.\n- **Relief -** Gain a +1 bonus if you heal
      a creature from existing wounds.\n- **Youth -** Gain a +1 bonus if the creature
      is a youngor juvenile member of its species.\n- **Pack or Herd is Present -**
      Suffer from a -1 penalty if the animal is in the company of members of its

      with the ability to recognize components in the flora and fauna around them
      letting characters extract materials from the environment.\n\n/\n\n\n### Components\nCharacters
      need to gather a different variety of components in order to brew herbalist
      solutions. These are reagents and mutagens. Each type of component can create
      different categories of solutions.\n\n### Toxicity\nA character that consumes
      solutions suffers from a number of toxicity points for each solution consumed.
      If a character\u2019s toxicity value is equal to or greater than the character\u2019s
      vigour, the character falls unconscious until the toxicity value is reduced.
      A character that receives a full rest reduces their toxicity by 1.\n\n### Recipes\nA
      character that wishes to brew a solution must have the recipe in their repertoire.
      A character that chooses this Profession immediately starts with 1 recipe of
      their choice. From there on a character must either discover recipes in the
      world, learn them from mentors or spend time and resources experimenting to
      create them, themself. Each individual recipe allows a character to learn a
      different effect for either Reagent Salves or Mutagenic Elixirs.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Gathering

      Salve\n-\nA reagent salve is designed to aid the body to heal. Salves are consumed
      by characters as bonus action and each salve that a character consumes causes
      the character to receive 1 point of toxicity. An alchemist\u2019s salve has
      an intensity value that is used to determine how strong its effect is. A salve
      can have any one of the following effects:\n- **Coagulation [X] -** Reduce
      a target character\u2019s blood loss intensity by an amount equal to X\n- **Cleansing
      [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s infection intensity by an amount equal

      mutagenic elixir is a body booster that grants a character a temporary enhancement
      on their natural ability. Elixirs are consumed by characters as bonus actions
      and each elixir that a character consumes causes the character to receive X
      points of toxicity as noted in the braces. An elixir can have any one of the
      following effects:\n- **Awareness [2] -** Character gains a boost to perception
      dice rolls and  a +10% bonus to perception range per elixir intensity.\n- **Speed

      Coating\n-\nToxin coatings are poured over weapons in order to impart harmful
      effects on targets. Applying a toxin coating on a weapon is a bonus action.
      A weapon that is coated with a toxin will impart its effect on the weapon\u2019s
      next attack after which the coating\u2019s effect is lost. A weapon can only
      ever have one coating on it, the last one that it received.  A coating has
      an intensity value that is used to determine how strong its effect is. A coating
      will inflict a number of toxin effects on a target equal to the coating\u2019s
      intensity value.  A coating can have any one of the following effects:\n- **Paralysis
      [X] -** Targets suffer from a penalty to movement points equal to X. If X is
      equal to or greater than the target\u2019s vigour, the target is slowed. A
      slowed target gains half of their action points.\n- **Enervation [X] -** Targets
      suffer from a hindrance to all actions. If X equal to or greater than the target\u2019s

      poured and smeared over armour and gear in order to impart beneficial and protective
      effects on the wearer and the item. An armour that is coated will retain its
      beneficial effects until the effects are depleted, the item is cleaned or a
      new coating is added on top of the old one. Any item can only ever benefit
      from one coating at a time. A coating can have any one of the following effects:\n-
      **Fire Retardant -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will
      remove the first 3 points of fire intensity that they receive after which the
      coating is removed.\n- **Anti-Freeze -** The wearer of an armour treated with
      this coating will remove the first 3 points of cold intensity that they receive
      after which the coating is removed.\n- **Grounding -** The wearer of an armour
      treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points of shock intensity
      that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n- **Lubricant -** The
      wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points
      of tangle intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n-
      **Alkalene -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove
      the first 3 points of corrosion intensity that they receive after which the
      coating is removed.\n\n)\nitem(\n#Combustible Petard\n-\nCombustible Petards
      are small handheld improvised explosive devices that can teach an unwitting
      opponent a hard lesson about bullying chemistry nerds. Igniting and throwing
      a Combustible petard takes 2 attack action points, one to ignite and one to
      throw. A character can use a bonus action to ignite if they so choose. A petard
      has an intensity value that is used to determine how many different effects
      it has. A petard can have any combination of the following effects:\n- **Intensity
      -** Increase the explosion\u2019s damage by +1 per effect.\n- **Blast Radius
      -** Grant the explosion a splash effect of 1m per effect.\n- **Shrapnel -**

      gunsmithing Profession allows a character to create and maintain all forms
      of firearms, cannons and their ammunition. As firearm designs become more intricate,
      components more precise and ammunition more deadly, so do their crafters have
      to become more masterful in their art.\n\n### Blacksmithing\nThe blacksmithing
      Profession allows a character to become an expert in metallurgy, fogging or
      ores and beating of metal to shape it into tools, weapons, armours, utensils,
      jewellery and any form of metallic reinforcement.\n\n### Leatherworking & Tailoring\nThe
      leatherworking and tailoring Profession deals with all forms of soft fabric
      crafting, harvesting and refining technique. With leatherworking & tailoring
      a character can not only create all forms of clothing and various armour but
      also extract, harvest and refine hides, leathers, linens, cottons, wools, furs
      and all forms of natural fibres.\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nitem(\n#Rarity & Requirements\n-\nEvery
      item in the game belongs to a rarity category. The four rarity categories are
      Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary. In order for a character to be able to
      repair, maintain, scavenge, craft or upgrade any item they must possess a skill
      level in their crafting skill that is equal to or greater than the item rarity
      rating. The rarity ratings are as follows:\n- **Common -** Rarity Rating 1,
      Trained Skill Level\n- **Uncommon -** Rarity Rating 2, Expert Skill Level\n-
      **Rare -** Rarity Rating 3, Master Skill Level\n- **Legendary -** Rarity Rating
      4, Legend Skill Level\n\n)\n\n\nitem(\n#Raw Materials\n-\nItems need an amount
      of raw materials in order to be created. Each raw material has a type and a
      rarity value. Wood, Metal, Leather, Fabric are all examples of types. The rarity
      level needs to match the rarity of the item being created. For example a Longsword
      is an Uncommon Metal Weapon with an ENC of 1 so a crafter needs 1 ENC of Uncommon
      Metal in order to craft it.\nPerforming repairs and upgrades also need raw
      materials, just less of them. Each repair and upgrade performed takes 1 unit
      of raw material (1 ENC) of the appropriate type.\n)\n\n|\n\n\nitem(\n#Tools\n-\nWhether
      a character is crafting, repairing, upgrading or scavenging, they can only
      do so if they have prerequisite tools in their possession. Repairs and scavenging
      can be done with portable tool kits while crafting and upgrading require workshops
      and crafting stations.\n)\n\n\nitem(\n#Crafting Time\n-\nEvery item that is
      created takes an amount of crafting time. This is calculated as a crafting
      time value which is equal to the item\u2019s ENC (min 1) x its rarity rating.
      Every time that a character spends 2 hours on a crafting action they must roll
      a crafting skill dice roll against a difficulty of 6 and the margin of success
      of this dice roll is added towards a total progress in the crafting of the
      item. Once the progress value is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete.\nRegardless
      of the crafting complexity each repair action takes 2 hours to perform.\nUpgrade
      actions take one half of an item's crafting complexity.\n)\n\n/\n\n=\n\n###
      Blueprints\n\nCharacters who have training in the Craft skill are able to craft
      any common item. For Uncommon items or rarer, they need to acquire a blueprint
      or create it by themself. In order for a character to create a blueprint from
      scratch they must perform a crafting action that consumes 5 times the normal
      amount of time and raw materials.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Craft\n##Camp 2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting
      Skill vs Difficulty 6\nCharacters withthe appropriate crafting profession can
      craft different item types. Blacksmiths can craft weapons and heavy armour.

      Gunsmiths can craft firearms and ammunition.\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Repair\n##Camp
      2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting Skill vs Difficulty 6\nItems that are broken, damaged
      or otherwise rendered inoperable can be repaired to restore them to their normal
      functionality. A repair action is the same as a crafting action, i.e. a crafting
      skill dice roll that consumes 2 hours. Unlike crafting however, repairs do
      not consume raw materials, but impose all other restrictions (i.e. a character
      must have the prerequisite skills to craft an item in order to be able to repair
      it).\n)\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Scavenge\n##Camp 2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting Skill vs
      Difficulty 6\nItems can be broken down into their components in order to recover
      some raw materials from them. When doing so the quality of the materials deteriorates
      as a consequence of scavenging. The amount of Raw materials scavenged in ENC
      is the same as the ENC of the item but the quality of raw material is one rating
      less than the item's rarity (to a minimum of 1, Common). For example Scavenging
      a rare item of ENC 3 yields ENC 3 worth of uncommon materials.)\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Upgrade\n##Camp
      2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting Skill vs Difficulty 6\nItems can receive one or more
      upgrades after that they are crafted. Each item can receive any upgrade that
      applies to its item type and may receive multiple upgrades on it if the crafter
      has enough skill however items can never receive the same upgrade more than
      once unless otherwise specified. An item can receive up to 4 different upgrades
      but a crafter must have an appropriate skill level to apply the second, thrid
      or fourth upgrade.\nThe number of upgrades that a character can apply on a
      single item is limited by the character\u2019s skill modifier in crafting.
      For example a character who is a master in this skill can add up to 3 different
      upgrades on the same item.\n)\n\n=\n\n\nitem(\n#Melee Weapon Upgrades\n-\n-

      Phase\n\n-\n\nAt the beginning of a round of combat all participants that are
      aware of danger perform an initiative dice roll which is rolling 1d10 + the
      character\u2019s initiative modifier (calculated by taking the character's
      perception skill value + any additional bonuses from traits, and talents and
      gear). The results of character\u2019s initiatives are used to tally the order
      in which participants take turns at performing actions.\n\n\n### Initiative
      Score\nCharacters use their perception to determine their initiative score.
      A character\u2019s initiative bonus is equal to the character\u2019s perception
      skill modifier. Additional initiative bonuses and penalties are applied by
      circumstance, equipment and talents. Similarly characters that are gifted or
      deficient in perception have boosted or hindered perception dice rolls.\n\n###
      Initiative Actions\nCharacters and creatures benefit from talents and special
      abilities that may be activated during the initiative phase before a combat
      round starts. While performing initiative dice rolls, characters can choose
      to activate one such ability in order to gain its effect. If a character has
      more than one ability that is activated as an initiative action, they must
      choose which one of their initiative abilities they want to choose and may
      never benefit from more than one at a time.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Combat Turn\n\n-\n\nDuring
      their combat turn characters receive a number of movement points, a main action
      and a bonus action to spend on actions that they want to perform during their
      turn. \n\n/\n\n\n\n### Movement Points\n\n-\n\nDuring a character\u2019s turn
      a character that is able to move may spend 1 action point in orer to receive
      movement points. A character can freely spend movement points before, after
      and during any action and in between. \n\nWhen a chracter spends 1 action point
      to perform movement they receive a number of movement points. The number of
      movement points gained is calculated as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**5 + (Athletics
      skill modifier x2)**\n\n)\n\nA character can spend more than 1 action point
      on movement actions. Each action point spent beyond the first adds their Athletics
      skill modifier x2 again. If a character is untrained in Athletics they gain
      1 movement point instead.\n\nEach movement point spent allows a character to
      do the following.\n\n- **Hustle -** Run 1m per point spent. Walk 1m per 2 points
      spent to do so stealthily.\n- **Jump -** Vault 1m per 2 points spent.\n- **Crawl
      -** Scurry 1m per 2 points spent. This counts as stealthy movement.\n- **Swim
      -** Paddle 1m per 2 points spent. Paddle 1m per 3 points spent to do so stealthily.\n-
      **Climb -** Scale 1m per 2 points spent up comfortable surfaces (ladders, knotted
      ropes, sheer surfaces aided by grapple hooks & climbing gear) or 1m per 3 points
      spent for free climbing.\n- **Stand Up -** Standing up from being knocked down
      costs 3 movement points.\n- **Go Prone -** Going down into a prone position
      takes 1 movement point.\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Hiding and Sneaking\n\n-\n\nDuring
      their turn a character can spend their their movement points in order to hide
      or sneak. If a character is currently out of line of sight or within a source
      of cover, concealment or any manner of environment that would obscure their
      presence, they may spend a 2 movement points to hide. \n\nA character that
      performs a hiding action gains a stealth score equal to 1 + their stealth skill
      modifier\n\nFrom the moment a character performs such actions they are considered
      to be hidden unless an observer with a perception score equal to or higher
      than their stealth is directly looking at them. \n\nEvery action a character
      performs that is noticeable (such as moving objects, manipulating devices or
      attacking) reduces a character\u2019s stealth score by -1 or -2 depending on
      the circumstance.\n\nA character can gain a +1 bonus to their stealth score
      for every 3 additional movement points they decide to spend on hiding.\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
      Movement Modifiers\n\n-\n\n/\n\n\n**Boosted Movement -** Characters that are
      moving in favour of a powerful current, or who have been given a helping push
      towards a direction benefit from a bonus to their movement. Characters that
      are boosted in such ways double the distances moved per movement point spent..\n\n**Hindered
      Movement -** Characters that are encumbered, hamstrung or attempting to move
      against an overwhelming current or a hindering force suffer from a penalty
      to their movement. Characters that are hindered in such ways half all the distances
      moved per movement point spent.\n\n**Entangled -** Characters that are currently
      caught to webs, ropes, hogtied, or grappled with an opponent may not use movement
      points to perform movement (walk, crawl, climb, swim etc). They may still perform
      other actions, however a lot of actions that require freedom of movement may
      be also hindered by the character being entangled.\n\n**Knocked Down -** Characters
      that have become unbalanced and have been knocked off of their feet must spend
      3 movement points in order to regain balance.\n\n**Prone -** Characters that
      went down to a prone position (not ones that were knocked down) gain a +1 bonus
      to their cover if they were within a source of cover, they gain a cover bonus
      of 1 if they were not previously in cover, and gain a +1 bonus to their stealth
      score. From a prone position a character can only crawl and must stand up before
      being able to do any other type of movement action. Performing attacks from
      a prone position is always hindered.\n\n**Rough Terrain -** Shallow water,
      thick mud, deep sand or snow and uneven rocks all contribute to poorly transmit
      back a creature\u2019s footfall energy. Any form of rough terrain will cause
      a character traversing it to go slower than normal. Generally rough terrain
      will cause a character to suffer from hindered movement.\n\n|\n\n**Slippery
      Terrain -** Icy lakes, wet moss, muddy stone and most tiled sloping roofs are
      usually quite precarious and slippery for anyone attempting to traverse them.
      In addition to being examples of rough terrain, a character moving through
      one or more meters of slippery terrain must perform an athletics dice roll
      in order to avoid falling prone. The basic difficulty is 6 and for every 2
      meters traversed within the same movement action the difficulty increases by
      +1.\n\n**Dangerous Terrain -** Dangerous terrain defines any environment that
      is immediately hostile to a character like acid pools, magma puddles, flash
      fires, thorns and brambles and any form of spikes and blades jutting out of
      the environment. In addition to being examples of rough terrain a character
      moving through one or more meters of dangerous terrain must perform an athletics
      dice roll in order to avoid taking a wound. The basic difficulty is 6 and for
      every 2 meters traversed within the same movement action the difficulty increases
      by +1.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Attacking\n\n-\n\nCharacters can perform attacks
      against targets during their combat turn by spending their action points. A
      character can perform both close combat and ranged combat actions within the
      same turn however they must perform a Combat Stance action to switch weapons
      in between attacks.\n\n### Attack Dice Roll\n\n-\n\nrules(\n\n**Close combat
      attack = close combat skill dice roll vs target\u2019s defence**\n\n**Ranged
      combat attack = ranged combat skill dice roll vs difficulty of 6**\n\n)\n\nBoth
      of the above take 1 action point each.\n\n\n\n### Combat Stance\n\n-\n\nThe
      combat stance action allows a character to perform certain actions during a
      hostile situation that would divert their attention away from the enemy, even
      if temporarily. This includes things like drawing a weapon, storing it in its
      sheath, reloading a weapon, retreiving a weapon or ammunition from a pouch
      or pocket, going down into a prone position or standing up from a prone position.
      Once  a character has spent 1 action point on combat stance they may perform
      any number of these actions any number of time as they want until the start
      of their next turn.\n\n\n\n## Attack Modifiers\n\n-\n\n\n**Flanking -** If
      two or more allied characters are attacking the same target and surrounding
      it in any way that causes any line drawn from their occupied squares to cross
      the target\u2019s occupied square, the attackers are considered to be flanking.
      Flanking attackers benefit from boosted attacks.\n\n**Hamstrung -** Characters
      that are in any way shape or form hindered in their movement suffer from a
      penalty to their defence. If a character is suffering from effects that are
      causing them to lose half of their movement points they suffer from a -1 penalty
      to defence. If a character is suffering from effects that are causing them
      to lose all of their movement points they suffer from a -2 penalty to their
      defence.\n\n**Surprise -** Attacks that come from an enemy that a defender
      is not aware of causes their defence to go down to 4. While unaware a character
      cannot perform reactions.\n\n**Cover -** Characters that are within source
      of cover and concealment are harder to hit and more likely to dodge out of
      incoming fire. The difficulty to hit a character in cover increases by +1 for
      partial cover and +2 for full cover.\n\n**Elevation -** Characters that are
      occupying higher ground are at an advantage as they are able to have a better
      overview of the battlefield. Elevated characters always count as having partial
      cover and can ignore 1 point of a target\u2019s cover.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Combat
      Maneuvers\n\n-\n\nIn addition to attacks during a turn a character can spend
      their action points to perform a combat maneuver. A combat maneuver can be
      performed at any time in order to benefit from its effect.\n\n/\n\n\n\n###
      Combat Maneuvers\n\n-\n\n- **Aid -** Grant an ally within 1m a +1 bonus on
      their next attack dice roll. This maneuver can be performed multiple times
      on the same or different allies each time adding an additional +1.\n- **Called
      Attack -** Declare a target zone to gain the following bonuses and penalties
      to attack:\n- **[Arm] -** Suffer from a -1 to attack dice roll and inflict
      a number of arm injury points equal to the margin of success on the dice roll.
      As long as a creature has 1 or more arm injury points they suffer from a hindrance
      to all attacks made with that arm. If the arm injury points are equal to or
      greater than the creature\u2019s vigour an additional hindrance is added.\n-
      **[Leg] -** Suffer from a -1 to attack dice roll and inflict a number of leg
      injury points equal to the margin of success on the dice roll. As long as a
      creature has 1 or more leg injury points they suffer from a -1 penalty to movement
      points. If the leg injury points are equal to or greater than the creature\u2019s
      vigour the creature suffers from losing 1/2 of their movement points.\n- **[Head]
      -** Suffer from a -2 to attack dice roll and inflict a number of head injury
      points equal to the margin of success on the dice roll. As long as a creature
      has 1 or more head injury points they suffer from a hindrance to all dice rolls.
      If the head injury points are equal to or greater than the creature\u2019s
      vigour, that creature falls unconscious.\n- **Overwatch -** Declare any set
      of 4 adjacent squares within line of sight and weapon range. Until the start
      of the next turn, whjen a valid target enters or exits any one of those squares,
      you can perform an attack against that target. A character may perform one
      overwatch reaction attack per action point spent.\n- **Overrun -** Perform
      an athletics dice roll against the defence of an opponent whose occupied square
      you wish to traverse. On a successful dice roll you may move through the occupied
      square as long as you have enough movement to reach an empty space.\n- **Protect 
      -** Grant an ally within 1m a +1 bonus to defence against the next attack that
      targets them directly. This maneuver can be performed multiple times on the
      same or different allies each time adding an additional +1.\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n###
      Combat Maneuvers\n\n-\n\n- **Disarm -** Perform a close combat skill action
      against a target\u2019s defence. If the margins of success exceed the target's
      attack bonus a held item falls to their feet.\n- **Feint -** Perform a close
      combat skill action against a target's willpower. On a successful dice roll
      the target suffers from a -1 penalty to defence against the next attack that
      targets them.\n- **Grapple -** Perform a close combat skill action against
      a target\u2019s vigour. On  a successful result that target is grappled. Neither
      grappled or grappler may use movement actions (walking, crawling, climbing
      swimming etc) and can only attack each other. A grappled target is considered
      to be hindered when performing attacks.\n- **Parry -** Gain a bonus to defence
      against the first close combat attack that targets you equal to your close
      combat skill modifier.\n- **Push -** Perform a close combat skill action against
      a target\u2019s vigour. On a successful result the target is forcefully moved
      directly away from you a distance equal to 1m for every 2 margins of success.\n-
      **Trip -** Perform a close combat skill action against a target\u2019s vigour.
      On a successful result the target falls prone. Prone characters are hindered
      when performing movement and attack actions and must spend 3 movement points
      to remove the prone condition.\n- **Take Aim -** Reduce the penalties incurred
      by distance by 1 point for the next ranged attack performed.\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
      Perception Range\n\n-\n\nCharacters that are performing actions at a range
      find more difficulty the farther away an object is from their sight.\n\nrules(\n\n**Perception
      range = 20m + perception skill x20m.**\n\n)\n\nA character can perform actions
      with a target within their perception range at no penalty. Every time that
      the perception range is exceeded, a cumulative -1 penalty is applied to the
      dice roll. For example a character with a perception range of 10 will not suffer
      any penalties for targeting at 3m, 6m or 10m of distance, they will suffer
      form a -1 penalty for targeting at 11m, 17m or 14m of distance and they will
      suffer from a -2 penalty for targeting at 22m, 28m or 30m of distance.\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
      Perception Score\n\n-\n\nCharacters have a passive perception score that allows
      them to notice things at a distance. While nearly everything within the world
      can be easily seen and understood by a character as long as objects are large
      enough and well illuminated enough, a character\u2019s perception score allows
      them to notice creatures, characters and objects that are out of place, suspicious
      or curious. \n\nrules(\n\n**Perception score = perception skill modifier +1**\n\n)\n\nA
      character suffers from a -1 penalty to perception for every hindrance that
      they are suffering from, be it distance, darkness, noise etc. Objects that
      are hidden or characters that are hiding have a stealth value depending on
      how well hidden they are. If a character\u2019s perception score is higher
      than a target\u2019s stealth score, the character is aware of the target.\n\n/\n\n\n\n##
      Defence\n\n-\n\n/\n\nWhen characters are targeted by a close combat attack,
      their attacker performs their skill dice roll against a difficulty determined
      by a character\u2019s defence score. In essence a highly trained close combatant
      is better at dodging, blocking and parrying incoming blows. A character\u2019s
      defence score is as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**6 + Close combat skill modifier**\n\n)\n\n\n\n##
      Dealing Damage\n\n-\n\nWhen a target has been hit with a successful attack
      they suffer from damage. The attack\u2019s damage value is calculated as such:\n\nrules(\n\n**Attack
      action margin + weapon damage**\n\n)\n\nIf this damage bonus is greater than
      the target\u2019s soak value, the target suffers from a wound.\n\n\n\n### Soak\n\n-\n\nCharacters
      that receive damage have a chance to soak it and brush it off. A character\u2019s
      soak value is calculated as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**1 + ARM value of the armour
      they are wearing**\n\n)\n\n\n\n### Critical Hits\n\n-\n\nWhen an attacker gains
      a critical on their attack dice roll, they may inflict an additional wound
      beyond the first on their attack for every time that the damage exceeds the
      target\u2019s soak.\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Wounds\n\n-\n\nA character\u2019s wounds
      represent how many times they can be seriously hurt in battle before they fall.
      A character\u2019s maximum wounds are calculated as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**1
      + Conditioning skill modifier**\n\n)\n\nIf an injured character is 1 wound
      away from being incapacitated they suffer from a -2 penalty to all actions.
      If an injured character is 2 wounds away from being incapacitated they suffer
      from a -1 penalty to all actions. A character\u2019s maximum wounds are equal
      to 1 + their Conditioning skill modifier.\n\n\n\n### Incapacitated, Unconscious
      and Dead\n\n-\n\nWhen a character or a creature has suffered from a number
      of wounds equal to their maximum wounds they become incapacitated.\n\nAn incapacitated
      character gains one half their normal action points during their turn. If an
      incapacitated character takes an additional wound, they become unconscious.\n\nUnconscious
      characters are prone, helpless and unable to perform any actions and thus don\u2019t
      gain action points during their turn. If an unconscious character takes an
      additional wound they die.\n\n=\n\n\n\n### Stress\n\n-\n\nCharacters that get
      hit in combat are subject to psychological wounds. A character that is hit
      by an attack causes them to receive a Stress point even if that attack didn't
      deal any damage.\n\nWhen a character's total stress points exceed the character\u2019s
      willpower, the character becomes frightened and suffers from a hindrance to
      all actions. If a character\u2019s stress value exceeds their willpower twice,
      they become panicked. \n\nA panicked character must use their movement and
      actions during their turn to escape from danger, ideally by putting as much
      distance from them and any perceived threat or failing that finding the closest
      place in cover (ideally out of line of sight) and cowering there. If running
      away from where they are is immediately and obviously more dangerous than staying
      put, a panicking character will use their turn cowering instead.\n\nA panicked
      character can spend an action point at the start of their turn to avoid running
      away and instead freezing place.\n\n\n\n### Removing Stress\n\n-\n\nStress
      accumulates as a character survives hostile situations but there are a number
      of ways how a character can reduce their stress build up.\n\n- **Full Rest
      -** 1 stress point is automatically removed whenever a character sleeps.\n-
      **Meal -** Once per day a character can remove 1 stress from eating a meal
      if they are doing so in a safe and comfortable environment. Higher quality
      foods and drinks can further enhance this stress relieving effect.\n- **Leisure
      Time -** Characters can choose to spend their free time doing anything to take
      their minds off of things. For every hour of leisure time a chracter reduces
      1 stress point. \n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Injury & Infection\n\n-\n\nCharacters that
      have suffered from one or more wounds are considered to be injured and thus
      become susceptible to blood loss and infection.\n\n\n### Pain\nCharacters that
      have suffered from wounds in battle start suffering from pain. A character
      who has a number of wounds equal to half of their total suffers from a hindrance
      to all dice rolls. During their turn they may spend 1 action point to fight
      through the pain and ignore the penalty until the start of their next turn.\n\n###
      Blood Loss\nOne minute after that a character has suffered from a wound and
      for every minute thereafter a character gains 1 intensity of blood loss. As
      long as a character has 1 intensity of blood loss they suffer from a -1 penalty
      to initiative. If a character\u2019s blood loss intensity is equal to or greater
      than their vigour, the character falls unconscious. If a character\u2019s blood
      loss intensity is equal to or greater than twice their vigour, the character
      dies.\n\n### Infection\nOne hour after that a character has suffered from a
      wound and for every hour thereafter a character gains 1 intensity of infection.
      As long as a character has 1 intensity of infection they suffer from 1 point
      of injury penalty. This is in addition to any other injury penalty. For every
      time that the character\u2019s vigour is matched in infection intensity the
      injury penalty increases by 1. If a character\u2019s injury penalty is equal
      to or greater than their vigour, the character dies.\n\n### Healing\nCharacters
      that perform full rest in a comfortable shelter can heal wounds naturally.
      If a character\u2019s blood loss is stopped and their wounds are treated, a
      period of full rest will reduce the character\u2019s infection by 1. If a character
      no longer has infection, they instead remove 1 wound. Comfortable shelter requires
      a character to rest in dry and warm conditions.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Hazards\n\n-\n\n\n###
      Falling Damage\nCreatures that fall down from heights suffer impact damage
      based on the distance that they fell. This damage is an attack that automatically
      hits and does an amount of damage equal to 1 for every meter fell. This attack
      is a critical hit which means that for every time that the damage reaches the
      soak value an additional wound is inflicted. For example a character with a
      soak of 3 that suffers 7 damage will suffer from 2 wounds.\n\n### Damage from
      Falling Objects\nBig heavy objects crashing down on characters cause an amount
      of damage based on the debris weight. Unless a falling object is directly aimed
      towards a character, in which case it is treated as a normal ranged attack,
      falling objects around characters will allow potential targets to perform athletics
      dice rolls to dive out of the way. The normal difficulty is 6 allowing a character
      to dive 1m out of the way per margin of success and unspent movement points.
      If a character is hit, a falling object deals an amount of damage equal to
      its ENC +1 per meter that it fell. This attack is always considered a critical
      hit.\n\n### Extreme Temperatures\nCharacters that are navigating through terrain
      of extreme cold or extreme hot environs suffer from Hypothermia and Hyperthermia.
      In both cases a character will receive 1 intensity of the Extreme Temperature
      effect for every hour that they spend without shelter. Whenever this intensity
      equalizes with a character\u2019s Vigour their maximum stamina is reduced by
      1. When a character\u2019s maximum stamina is reduced to 0 they fall unconscious.
      The next time the maximum stamina needs to be reduced they die. Maximum stamina
      loss is restored at a rate of 1 per full rest.\n\n### Starvation & Dehydration\nCharacters
      need to consume 1 meal per day minimum in order to survive. If they are unable
      to procure edible food and potable water they will suffer from Starvation &
      Dehydration. A character gains 1 intensity of Starvation every 24 hours and
      1 intensity of Dehydration every 6 hours.Whenever this intensity equalizes
      with a character\u2019s Vigour their maximum stamina is reduced by 1. When
      a character\u2019s maximum stamina is reduced to 0 they fall unconscious. The
      next time the maximum stamina needs to be reduced they die. Maximum stamina
      loss is restored at a rate of 1 per full rest.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Maladies\n\n-\n\n/\n\n\n\n###
      Poisons and Diseases\n\n-\n\nWhen a creature is afflicted by a type of malady,
      a poison, venom, toxin or disease, their Vigour comes into play. Each individual
      poison or disease comes with an intensity value. When a player is afflicted
      by a malady they gain a certain amount of intensity points in that malady.
      As long as the player has at least 1 or more intensity they count as being
      afflicted and thus suffer from the malady\u2019s effects. When the intensity
      of the malady increases to match or exceed the character\u2019s Vigour, the
      character starts suffering from a malady\u2019s acute effects. Certain maladies
      can be fatal or have effects that worsen depending on how many intensity points
      the malady reaches.\n\nThe following is an example of a malady:\n\n\n\n####
      Paralytic Poison\n\nnote(\nWhen a character is struck with an attack affected
      by paralytic poison they gain +1 intensity in Paralytic poison immediately
      and +1 intensity at the start of every turn thereafter for 2 minutes (20 rounds).\n\n\n**Mild
      Effect -** As long as a character has 1 or more intensity points in paralytic
      poison they suffer from a penalty to movement points gained per turn equal
      to -1 for every 2 intensity points in paralytic poison.\n\n**Acute Effect -**
      If a character has a number of intensity points in paralytic poison equal to
      or greater than their Vigour score, they are slowed. A slowed character must
      forego their main action or their bonus action at the beginning of their turn.\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n|\n\n\n\n###
      Curses and Hexes\n\n-\n\nCharacters that become cursed or are suffering from
      a hex are in essence beneath the crushing thumb of a sickness, one that affects
      their soul. Curses and hexes work exactly like Poisons and diseases and thus
      are considered to be maladies. Their only difference is that instead of combating
      them with Vigour a character combats them with Willpower.\n\nThe following
      is an example of a curse:\n\n\n\n#### Witch\u2019s Jinx\n\nnote(\nA character
      that performs any action that could cause harm to the witch gains +1 intensity
      in Witch\u2019s Jinx immediately and +1 intensity whenever they perform any
      action that may cause harm to the witch.\n\n\n**Mild Effect -** As long as
      a character has 1 or more intensity points in Witch\u2019s jinx they suffer
      from a hindrance to all dice rolls performed against the witch.\n\n**Acute
      Effect -** If a character has a number of intensity points in Witch\u2019s
      jinx equal to or greater than their Willpower score, any damage they inflict
      upon the Witch is also inflicted to them.\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n### Recovering from
      Maladies \n\n-\n\nEvery malady can be recovered from but the methods of recovery
      differ. Most diseases can be recovered with rest and nursing. For example a
      full rest period allows a character to reduce a disease\u2019 intensity by
      a value equal to their Vigour as long as they are well fed and resting comfortably.
      Poisons on the other hand require medical intervention. Immediate blood letting
      or applying of tourniquets for instance can stop a poison\u2019s intensity
      from worsening or at least slow it down from affecting the character every
      minute instead of every turn. Antidotes and detoxification needs to occur to
      remove the effect fully. Curses need to be removed by divine intervention,
      thus most people turn to members of the clergy or exorcists although folk magic
      and artisanal remedies are also said to work. In the case of most curses an
      intervention will remove a curse completely or halt it from progressing however
      certain powerful curses will require specific odd tasks to be performed in
      order to free the afflicted from the malady.\n\n=\n\n\n\n"

        brought with them joy and ardour in equal measure. The tales of heroes, kings,
        empires and legends all get brought down from generation to generation through
        the silvery tongues of able bard who are capable of not only espousing the
        virtues of the characters that they subject, but also capable of revealing
        the vile vitriol of villains that they insult. Either way, anyone with the
        coin to spare knows to toss a coin to their minstrel from time to time.

      Dance [3 Initiative]\nActivating blade dance grants the user the effects of

      an attack with your off hand weapon for every attack performed with your main
      hand weapon.\n\n#### Riposte [1AP]\nWhen an enemy attack fails to hit you spend
      an action point to immediately perform a close combat attack followed by any
      one maneuver against that opponent.\n\n#### Combat Expertise [1 Stamina]\nUntil

      attacks performed this turn.\n\n#### Whirlwind Attack [1 Stamina and 1AP]\nPerform
      one attack against all targets within your weapon\u2019s range.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n#
      Duellist\n\n-\n\nIn the late imperial age a number of mercenary companies had
      eventually developed into fully fledged low aristocratic houses each guarding
      jealously decades if not centuries of accumulated martial knowledge. These
      advanced and unique martial arts had created a unique class of fighter, a skirmisher
      capable of holding their own in small numbers and working outside of a normal
      military structure.\n\n\n#### Expertise [5 Movement Points]\nWhen rolling initiative
      gain a +2 bonus to Initiative. This causes you to receive 5 movement points
      less than normal if you spend action points on movement.\n\n#### Trick [1AP]\nAdd

      between you and your attacker.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Druid\n\n-\n\nThose who are
      gifted in the voice haven't always sought the power of divine pantheons and
      have instead turned their ear to the primordial primal forces of nature. Shamans,
      mystics and feral mages of all ilks used to roam the lands in the era of the
      tribes and all of their ways have coalesced into what is nowadays known as
      the Druid. The feral divine arts are a loose collection of spiritual traditions
      and superstitious heritages that came together to create the way of nature\u2019s
      guardian.\n\n\n#### Beast Aspect [3 Initiative]\nGain one of the following:
      \n**Wings -** Gain the ability to fly. \n**Fangs & Claws -** Gain +1 damage

      until the start of your next turn.\n\n\n#### Geomancy [1AP]\nAlter an area
      of terrain of 4mx4m (or any combination of 16 1mx1m squares). The terrain is
      turned into mud, sand, solid rock, shallow water or ice until the start of
      your next turn when it goes back to normal. Characters standing in or moving
      through this terrain are hindered and it counts as rough terrain.\n\n#### Master
      of the Wilds [1 Focus]\nUntil the end of the encounter you or another allied
      creature within 10m of you benefit from the effects of animal form. In addition
      to the normal beast aspects, you can now choose from the following list as
      well. \n**Snapjaw -** Close combat attacks benefit from pierce, maim and slash.
      \n**Venom -** Wounded targets that survive that attack are poisoned. Poisoned
      characters are hindered when performing dice rolls. \n**Regenerate -** Spend
      a main action to restore 1 lost wound point.\n\n#### Terraforming [1 Focus]\nPerform
      a geomancy effect that is permanent.\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n# Elementalist\n\n-\n\nThe
      first flame is legendarily attributed to have been created by Galstaff of the
      Meridian shamans. While actual evidence is hard to come by from such ancient
      times it is clear that elemental magic was originally known by its first name,
      i.e. \u201CMagic\u201D. The ways of manipulating the elements have followed
      civilization from the very start and are greatly attributed to be the pillar
      of power that allowed the empire to form.\n\n\n#### Levitate [3 Initiative]\nDuring
      this turn you may fly at a distance of 1m per 2 movement points spent.\n\n####
      Blast [1AP]\nMake a spellcasting attack against a target\u2019s Willpower within
      20m that deals +2 damage. An attack that hits, inflicts an amount of fire,
      cold or shock tokens on the target equal to the dice roll\u2019s margin. If
      the amount of tokens is equal to or greater than the target\u2019s soak, they
      suffer from the token\u2019s effect. \n**Fire -** A creature that is burning
      suffers 1 wound and gains an additional fire token at the end of its turn.
      \n**Cold -** A creature that is freezing suffers from a -1 penalty to movement
      points for every cold token and as long as they have at least 1 cold token
      they suffer from -1 to action points. \n**Shock -** A creature that is electrocuted
      suffers from a hindrance to all dice rolls. \nA creature can spend 1AP to reduce
      1 token for each action point spent.\n\n#### Counter [1AP]\nNullify the casting
      of a spell within 20m of you. Roll a spellcasting dice roll against the target\u2019s
      Willpower.\n\n#### Explosion [1 Focus]\nChoose a 4x4 area fully within 20m
      of you or draw a straight line from yourself up to 20m away. All targets within
      this area are hit with a Blast of your choice.\n\n#### Elemental Control [1
      Focus]\nUntil the end of the encounter during your turn choose any 3 targets
      that currently have fire, cold, or shock tokens (or natural sources of heat,
      cold or electricity), roll a spellcasting dice roll against the target\u2019s
      Willpower and do any of the following. \nAlter - Double or half the amount
      of tokens on the target. Halfing 1 token removes it completely. \nSwap - Swap
      the tokens that two or more chosen targets have on them with each other.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n#
      Knight\n\n-\n\nThe chivalric code has existed for as long as there were lords
      wealthy enough to pay for their armed house warriors. Knights are more than
      mere highly paid and equipped brutes. Either born of noble stock or commoners
      elevated to a higher societal position, the knight is a sworn champion in service
      of their king or emperor, a defender of the lands and the interests of their
      banners.\n\n\n#### Bulwark [3 Initiative]\nGain a +1 bonus on Soak if you are
      currently wearing armour or holding a shield.\n\n#### Guard [1AP]\nUntil the
      start of the next turn when an enemy character walks within range of your weapon,
      immediately perform an attack against that enemy.\n\n#### Defend [1AP]\nGrant
      the effect of the Protect maneuvre to all allies within range instead of just
      one.\n\n#### Weapon Master [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of the next turn when
      performing a close combat attack you may confer any of the following effects
      to your blow. Push, Slam, Maim, Pierce.  A character can spend 1 extra action
      point in order to confer three effects instead of one.\n\n#### Cleave [1 Stamina]\nUntil
      the start of the next turn when performing a close combat attack, choose an
      additional two targets beyond the first. All targets are affected the same
      and must be within the weapon\u2019s range.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n# Monk\n\n-\n\nAncient
      arts as old as Orienta itself the ways of the warrior monks have travelled
      westward and propagated throughout the lands as a storm. The magnificent displays
      of athleticism and superhuman dexterity had often captured the imaginations
      of foreigners that witnessed them but monks and their monasteries were never
      a monolith that aligned themself with any one faction or nation. Those lucky
      enough to have monks among their allies had a rare privilege.\n\n\n#### Technique
      [3 Initiative]\nGain any 1 of the following:\nDouble the amount of movement
      points gained.\nGain +1 AP.\n\n#### Kata [1AP]\nUntil the start of the next
      turn whenever performing an unarmed attack that hits a target, you may immediately
      perform a close combat maneuver against the same target.\n\n#### Jutsu [1AP]\nUntil
      the start of the next turn while unarmoured you gain the benefit of parry against
      a number of attacks equal to your close combat modifier x2.\n\n#### Counter

      that doesn\u2019t hit you, you may immediately perform an unarmed attack against
      them.\n\n#### Flurry of Blows [1 Stamina]\nUntil the end of the encounter while
      unarmed, perform two unarmed attacks for each attack point spent.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n#
      Necromancer\n\n-\n\nOne of the most ancient forms of arcane study is the study
      of death and the dying. Although initially banned by the empire it was clear
      that the utility and demand for the services of necromancers was too high and
      after decades of the nobility and aristocracy secretly employing and funding
      necromantic studies, it became a highly regulated practice and area of study
      with the talents of necromancers used in a variety of applications within imperial
      life.\n\n/\n\n\n#### Detect Life [3 Initiative]\nDuring this turn you may see
      the outline of living things through solid objects at a range equal to half
      your perception range.\n\n#### Corpse Explosion [1AP]\nMake a spellcasting
      dice roll against a target corpse\u2019s Willpower within 10m. If the dice
      roll is successful the target corpse explodes causing damage to its surroundings.
      The blast has an intensity value equal to the caster\u2019s spellcasting skill
      modifier. The blasts\u2019s attack dice roll bonus is equal to the intensity
      and its splash area is equal to the intensity x2m. If the corpse occupies a
      large space, extend the splash from outside the corpse\u2019s base area.\n\n####
      Undead Servant [1AP]\nThis spell\u2019s effects last until the end of the turn
      or until the undead servant dies. An undead servant has a power level equal
      to their summoner\u2019s spellcasting skill modifier. The servant\u2019s stats
      are as follows: \n*Defence [4+PL], Soak [PL], Vigour [4+PL], Willpower [4+PL],
      Perception Range [PL x20m], Movement Points [PL x2], Carrying Capacity  [PL
      x2], Max Wounds [PL], Action Points [PL]* \n\nAdditionally a necromancer can
      choose any one of the following features: \n- **Ghoul -** When this creature
      causes damage with their close combat attacks, they restore 1 wound. \n- **Wraith
      -** This creature gains a 20m ranged attack that causes +1 damage and inflicts
      2 stress points on successful hits. \n- **Zombie -** This creature gains 2
      extra wounds. \n- **Skeleton -** This creature gains +2 soak against piercing
      attacks and is immune to the piercing effect. \n\nIf an undead servant is destroyed
      the necromancer must perform a short rest before being able to summon them
      again.  \n|\n\n#### Rise [1 Focus]\nMake a spellcasting dice roll against a
      target corpse\u2019s willpower within 10m. If the dice roll is successful the
      target corpse rises as an undead servant. Undead servants have an initiative
      score equal to their controller and will last until the end of the encounter
      or until their controller dismisses them or dies. An undead servant returns
      with all of its wounds repaired but any lost limbs are not recovered. A necromancer
      can only have an amount of undead servants at any one time equal to their spell
      casting skill modifier. Once a servant is dismissed the corpse is destroyed.\n\n####
      Memento Mori [Main]\nCast this spell against a target living creature\u2019s
      willpower within 20m. The creature receives a memento mori mark with an intensity
      equal to the margin of success which allows the caster to inflict a number
      of stress points on the creature equal to the intensity once per turn. If the
      creature\u2019s stress is equal to or greater than the target\u2019s willpower,
      they suffer from a wound.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Ranger\n\n-\n\nBefore there were
      kingdoms, or cities, or villages or tribes there was the hunter. The ranger
      was not invented, they changed and adapted with the times leaving behind a
      civilization that desperately tried to keep up. Those who shunned the comforts
      of modernity and the safety of walls have embraced the wilds and became part
      of them. Even when the civilizations of the world were at their highest the
      rangers were still needed. Now they are needed more than ever.\n\n\n#### Relocate
      [3 Initiative]\nGain 2 Movement Points whenever performing an attack that deals
      damage.\n\n#### Weave [1AP]\nImmediately gain Athletics x2 movement points.
      Gain a bonus to defence equal to +1 for every 3 movement points used this turn
      on running, climbing and jumping. This bonus lasts until the start of the next
      turn.\n\n#### Momentum [1AP]\nImmediately gain Athletics x2 movement points.
      Gain a bonus to attack damage equal to +1 for every 3 movement points used
      this turn. This bonus lasts until the start of the next turn.\n\n#### Hail
      of Arrows [1 Stamina and 1AP]\nCombat stance is activated. until the start
      of your next turn, for every shot fired with your ranged weapon, you may fire
      an additional shot as part of the same action.\n\n#### Flurry of Blades [1
      Stamina]\nUntil the start of the next turn. Gain 1 action point for every enemy
      killed or knocked out. The maximum action points that a character can gain
      this way within a turn is equal to the amount of action points that they start
      with at the beginning of the turn.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n# Rogue\n\n-\n\nAs long
      as there are two people alive, someone will want someone dead. Thieves, assassins,
      spies and charlatans, the rogue\u2019s origins are inevitably tied to the lower
      classes of society, the shadows which hide the illicit from unassuming eyes.
      Despite this the services of the covert and the inconspicuous have always found
      plenty of use in the highest courts of nobility and the aristocrats who often
      look down upon the furtive, have called upon their services far more that they\u2019d
      like to admit.\n\n\n#### Sneak [Initiative]\nCharacter may perform a hide action
      by spending a bonus action or 3 movement points.\n\n#### Infiltrator [Bonus]\nWhen
      performing actions while hidden, spend a bonus action to reduce all penalties

      next turn. Gain a bonus to attack dice rolls equal to your stealth value -
      the target\u2019s perception score. This bonus can only be applied against
      surprised targets.\n\n#### Ghost [Main]\nSpend 1 Stamina to activate this talent.
      This talent lasts until the start of the next turn. Whenever using any main
      action or bonus action you may also hide into stealth for free.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n#
      Samurai\n\n-\n\nOriginally hailing from Orienta the way of the samurai is as
      much an immigrant as the warrior bureaucrats that brought the art with them.
      Samurai are honourable servants of their Daimyo and Shogun masters, sworn to
      a lifetime of service. The Samurai that travel outside of Orienta were ambassadors
      and diplomats, often sent on missions to discover trade and alliance partners
      abroad all the while keeping a watchful eye on the ever expanding empire.\n\n/\n\n\n####
      Iaido [Initiative]\nWhen rolling initiative, gain a +2 bonus on initiative
      dice rolls. This causes you to receive 3 movement points less than normal.\n\n####
      Kiai [Bonus]\nWhen causing damage with an attack, spend your bonus action.
      All enemies within 5m of your target receive a number of stress points equal
      to the damage caused by the attack.\n\n#### Kyudo [Bonus]\nWhen spending a
      bonus action to take aim with your ranged attack, your ranged attack gets boosted
      in addition to the aim bonus and the bonus affects all ranged attacks during
      your turn and not just the next one.\n\n#### Bushido [Main]\nSpend 1 Stamina
      to activate this talent. This talent lasts until the start of the next turn.
      When performing multiple attacks against the same target, gain a cumulative
      +1 bonus to attack dice rolls for every attack beyond the first.\n\n#### Yumihiki
      [Main]\nSpend 1 Stamina to activate this talent. This talent lasts until the
      start of the next turn. When performing a ranged attack you may confer any
      1 of the following effects to your shots. Slash, Push, Slam, Maim. A character
      can spend 1 attack point in order to confer three effects instead of one.\n\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\n\n\n#
      Tenebrist\n\n-\n\nOriginally Tenebral magic was attributed to the forces of
      the demon lords in their invasion. In reality tenebrothurgy was originally
      created by the Levantese, an arcane art that was stolen by the forces of the
      demon realm. Tenebral art resurged with the expansion of the horde and reached
      the empire when travellers learned in the obscure art reached imperial borders.
      Even so all the way to the end little was ever known or discovered about tenebrists
      and their shadow dancing.\n\n/\n\n\n#### Shadow leap [Initiative]\nWhen rolling
      initiative cast this spell. You must be standing within an obscured area. Choose
      another obscured area within range equal to your spellcasting skill modifier
      x10m and appear there. This action can be used while hiding without penalty.\n\n####

      action to activate this spell. The spell lasts until the start of the next
      turn. Choose an amount of square meters within 20m of you equal to your spellcasting
      skill modifier x2. Targets that start their turn, end their turn or move into
      these squares become entangled. Entangled targets must sacrifice their main
      action to become free or else they lose all of their movement points.\n|\n\n####
      Portals [Main]\nSpend 1 Focus point to activate this spell with an intensity
      equal to your spellcasting skill modifier. This spell remains active until
      the end of the encounter. Choose any two solid surfaces completely within 20m
      x intensity of you to project two connected portals, each of which can be up
      to 2 x intensity square meters in size. During your turn you can spend a bonus
      action or 3 movement points to move the Portals to new locations.\n\n#### Displacement

      them to ignore armour. During your initiative you can choose which of the abilities
      to activate and deactivate. \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n"

    System\n\n)\n-\n/\n\n\n## Risky Actions\n\n-\n\nA risky action is any action
    that requires a dice roll to determine whether or not that action is a success
    or not. In the core system a dice roll is performed by rolling a single ten sided
    die and adding a modifier on top, whether it be a bonus or a penalty. The final
    result determines whether the action is a success or not based on whether this
    value is equal to or greater than the action's difficulty value, which unless
    otherwise stated is 6 by default. \n\n\n\n## Margin \n\n-\n\nThe dice rolls final
    result minus the difficulty value equals the margin. In any action the higher
    the margin, the bigger the effect of that action\u2019s success. Inversely a
    negative margin signals a bigger failure. For example a character rolls a 7 against
    a difficulty value of 6 gains a margin of success of +1. A character that rolls
    a 3 against a difficulty value of 6 gains a margin of failure of -3. A margin
    of 0 is considered to be a nominal success, i.e. the action succeeds just barely.\n\n\n\n##
    Modifiers\n\n-\n\nCircumstances, a character\u2019s innate or learned skills
    and equipment grant bonuses and penalties to the final result of a dice roll.
    These are collectively known as modifiers. The most common modifiers come from
    character skills which govern a character\u2019s expertise. A character that
    is trained in a particular skill receives a bonus to dice rolls, usually a +1
    or +2. Circumstances that conspire against a character\u2019s success impose
    penalties to said dice rolls such as -1 or -2.\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Boosted and Hindered
    Actions\n\n-\n\nCircumstances can lead an action to be considered as boosted
    or hindered. A boosted action is one where the character performing it is doing
    so at such comfort or confidence that they are a lot less likely to fail. A hindered
    action if one where the character performing it is at a disadvantage, probably
    being actively hindered by an opposing force. An action that is boosted benefits
    from rolling two 10 sided dice and choosing the highest of the two. An action
    that is hindered suffers from rolling two 10 sided dice and choosing the lowest
    of the two.\n\n\n### Negating Boosts\nRegardless of how many different sources
    of boosts or hindrances a dice roll can only ever roll two dice and choose one,
    never more than two. Multiple sources of boosts and hindrances negate each other.
    An action that has equal amounts of boosts and hindrances counts as having neither.
    While an action that has more boosts than hindrances counts as being boosted
    and the reverse is also true. \n\n### Overboosting \nIf a dice roll is benefitting
    from 2 or more boosts in addition to the extra die the final result of the dice
    roll benefits from a +1 for every additional boos beyond the first, i.e. 3 boosts
    result in an additional die and a +2 bonus. The reverse is also true, a character
    performing a dice roll with 3 hindrances will roll an additional die and choose
    the lowest of the two and apply a -2 penalty on the final result.\n\n\n\n\n\n##
    Critical Success and Failure\n\n-\n\nCircumstances can conspire against a character\u2019s
    best efforts and end up in disaster. Alternatively the same circumstances can
    bring about spectacular results to those who know how to capitalize on them.
    When a character performs an action and the margin is less than -5 or greater
    than +5 that dice roll results in a critical success. Most skills define what
    a critical success or failure means individually but in general extreme situations
    occur when players over or under achieve.\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Immediate and Extended
    Actions\n\n-\n\nAll actions that characters perform fall into two broad time
    categories being immediate and extended. An immediate action yields a result
    immediately, i.e. the character that performs such an action doesn't have to
    wasit to see the outcome or the action itself can be performed in less than an
    in-game turn (about 6 seconds). Extended actions on the other hand take long,
    are laborious and require a characte to wait until they can see if they have
    succeeded or not. \n\n\n### Immediate Actions\nAll immediate actions are performed
    within a combat round. They do not all require dice rolls, as some are risky
    and others are not.\n\n### Extended Actions\nExtended actions are activities
    that usualy inclue crafting, repairing, upgrading, or researching items. A character
    that performs an extended action can choose to either perform a dice roll as
    normal or else 'take 5'. A character that chooses to take 5 does not roll a die
    and instead receives a result of 5 on their action for the purposes of their
    dice roll.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n# Characters\n\n)\n-\nEvery player controls
    one character and records their characters skills and limitations on their character
    sheet. Each sheet is separated into various sections.At the very top there\u2019s
    the general information section where the character\u2019s name classes and main
    racial traits are found. Directly below it there\u2019s the skills section where
    the character\u2019s expertise is recorded. This is followed by the character\u2019s
    defences and fuels which are the character\u2019s life lines and the tools they
    need to survive the harsh world. Finally below that are the character\u2019s
    talents and equipment, the things that help a character define themself and become
    unique.\n/\n\n\n## Character Creation\n\n-\n\nThe following list of steps are
    needed to be taken in order to complete a character.\n\n- Choose a name for your
    character. \n- Choose two Traits from any combination of two Heritages \n- Choose
    a Main Class and 1 Talent from that Class \n- Choose any 3 Skills and gain a
    Trained (+1) rank in those skills. \n- Choose one skill to be gifted in and one
    skill to be deficient in. \n- Calculate the Defences & Fuels.\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Experience & Advancements\n\n-\n\nPlayers that participate in a campaign will
    receive experience points during the course of play. A good rule of thumb is
    to consider that every game session a player will receive 1 experience point
    with extras doled out for fulfilling story goals, reaching milestones or achieving
    major successes or dramatic scenes.\n\nExperience points can be spent to gain
    and increase new skills and acquire new talents. During periods of rest a character
    can spend experience points to upgrade their skills and talents. The following
    is a cost list for each different level of skill or talent that a character wishes
    to advance in:\n\n- **Trained skill level -** 1 Experience point \n- **Expert
    skill level -** 2 Experience points, needs 3 skills at trained level\n- **Master
    skill level -** 3 Experience points, needs 3 skills at expert level \n- **Legend
    skill level -** 4 Experience points, needs 3 skills at master level\n- **Talent
    -** 5 + the current number of Talents in experience points \n\n\nA character
    can choose a cross class once they have learned at least 2 talents in their main
    class.\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n# Traits\n\n)\n-\nAt character creation a character
    can select a number of traits based on their ethnic and genetic heritage. Traits
    are small passive bonuses that further define a character\u2019s uniqueness.
    Each trait belongs to a racial heritage. A character can have traits from up
    to a maximum of two different categories.\n/\n\n\n## Catfolk\n\n-\n\nThe empire
    was always utterly fascinated by the colours, flavours, language, customs and
    pure mirth that the catfolk possessed. Despite their relatively small numbers,
    after imperial assimilation the cultural impact that the cats had on the empire
    was palpable. In truth the catfolk were an indomitable race, one who would have
    gleefully fought the empire down to the last claw, but somehow they saw something
    of worth within the empire that a lot of them decided to join them instead of
    trying to beat them. When civilization collapsed and nature reclaimed the world,
    the catfolk were left with a bitter sweet sentiment. On the one hand the nature
    that they were born and sworn to protect was now winning. On the other their
    new friends were gone forever and the world was never going to be ever the same.\n\n\n**Darkvision 
    -** This character ignores penalties to perception due to low light and darkness.\n\n**Equilibrium 
    -** This character ignores 10m worth of falling damage.\n\n**Ferality  -** This
    character has natural weapons allowing their unarmed attacks to deal +1 damage.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Dwarf\n\n-\n\nWhen the relentless wave of empire reached the ancient holds of
    the dwarves legend speaks of a mighty clash an honourable war, a proud struggle
    that, while it ended in the favour of the empire and the eventual annexation
    of the dwarven lands, the stoic and pragmatic dwarves fought valiantly against
    the inevitable. The truth however is that the same pragmatism and stoicism that
    had served the dwarven leadership for untold centuries made them pliable and
    easily swayed by the empire. The dwarves were assimilated into the old empire
    and unlike other non-human races their hard work and industriousness found them
    a perfect fit for a greedy empire who was always happy to profit from their sweat
    and blood.\n\n\n**Durability  -** This character ignores pain penalties.\n\n**Stubbornness 
    -**  If incapacitated this character loses 1 action point per turn instead of
    half.\n\n**Mettle  -** This character may spend an action point to ignore all
    effects caused by stress until the start of their next turn.\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n##
    Elf\n\n-\n\nThe Elves of Katacross have been forced to look helplessly as the
    world around them changed and left them behind. The elder forlorn elves had left
    the world, returning centuries later only to find that where once was a verdant
    garden, now a mighty industrial empire lay, an empire that had long outgrown
    the need for their wisdom, one that was disinterested in hearing their warnings.
    They had after all abandoned the world, what right did they have to have a say
    in its goings on? The younger among the elves are now forced to live with the
    consequences and hope that they can do better than their ancestors.\n\n\n**Auspex 
    -** This character can spend a bonus action to gain a +50% increase bonus to
    perception range until the start of their next turn.\n\n**Clarity -** If this
    character is not surprised in combat, they gain a +1 bonus to Initiative.\n\n**Concentration 
    -** Once per day this character restores 2 focus points with a partial rest instead
    of just 1.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Gnome\n\n-\n\nThe Gnomes were among the first denizens
    of the First-World that arrived on Katacross, finding a widespread planet wide
    empire full of cultures, colours, songs and experiences the likes of which they
    had never seen. It wasn\u2019t their fault that their sojourn within the wild
    and new world that they were experiencing became intoxicating. The empire offered
    endless food to sate their endless curiosity. When the calamity occurred and
    the gnomes found themselves unable to return to their ancestral homeworld, they
    thought little of it. Katacross was now a broken world, ever shifting, ever changing,
    tethering on the brink of utter destruction beneath the feet of vast unthinkable
    monstrosities. And the gnomes were going to be there to witness it all. What
    a glorious and fitting end.\n\n\n**Wit -** This character is talented at any
    mental skill. Academics, Crafting, Spellcasting, Survival, Stealth\n\n**Muse
    -** If this character is not surprised in combat, they gain a +1 bonus to Initiative.\n\n**Optimism
    -** Once per day this character restores 2 focus points with a partial rest instead
    of just 1.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Goblin\n\n-\n\nOut of all of the races that were
    assimilated by the empire, the goblins were those who joined the latest, largely
    as a fault of the empire\u2019s inability to understand and empathise with their
    idiosyncrasies. Even when the great chieftains of the goblin settlements finally
    relented to the encroachment of the Empire and started migrating their populations
    behind the mighty walls of the imperial cities, the \u2018civilised\u2019 goblins
    maintained their identity of chaos and unpredictability. They held their heads
    up high in a world all too happy to look down on them and carved profit for their
    own relentlessly despite being treated as second-class citizens. When the empire
    collapsed the remnant goblins were ready for it, more than any other race, they
    had centuries of experience living in a wild uncaring world, another one was
    not going to faze them.\n\n\n**Aggression -** This character can gain +1 action
    point if they do not spend any action points on movement\n\n**Celerity -** When
    this character spends more than 1 action point on movement, they gain an additional
    +5 movement points for every extra AP spent.\n\n**Resilience -** This character
    benefits from a +1 bonus to Vigour for the purposes of resisting poisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n##
    Halfling\n\n-\n\nThroughout the centuries halflings have always struggled to
    stand out and be visible. Their disposition to befriend and accept the other
    have made the halflings an easy friend for the empire to exploit and take advantage
    of. Throughout the existence of the old empire Halfling leadership struggled
    to be taken seriously and to have the many achievements and heroics of their
    numbers be acknowledged by the status quo loving bourgeois. As the empire collapsed
    and the wealthy and powerful were brought low the halflings could have let them
    sink, ignored their pleas for help, and taken advantage of the now weak and downtrodden.
    But Halflings are better than that.\n\n\n**Fortune -** Once per partial rest
    this character may benefit from using a luck point without spending it or needing
    to have it.\n\n**Furtivity -** When performing hiding actions this character
    benefits from a +1 bonus to stealth score.\n\n**Purity -** This character benefits
    from a +1 bonus to Willpower for the purposes of resisting curses and hexes.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Hobgoblin\n\n-\n\nWhen the armies of the Demon Lords of old fell many of the
    races claimed credit but none have a worthy claim as that of the hobgoblins.
    Originally created by the demon lords to be a highly disciplined and organised
    fighting force, the strategic boon the Hobgoblins brought to the armies of darkness
    was an often underestimated advantage. When it suddenly went missing and worse
    of all, turned in favour of the alliance of the light, the war was all but lost.
    The hobgoblins have operated as closely knit military hierarchies for generations,
    pledging loyalty to strong leaders and producing many a mighty tyrant of their
    own. When the power of the empire reached the horde many hobgoblin battalions
    recognized the strength of the imperial army. Some chose to fight the empire
    because enemies worth their strength were rare. Others chose to join the emperor
    because they could see the heartless tyrant at the helm of the imperial machine.
    When the empire fell the hobgoblins lay scattered and leaderless, forced to form
    feudal fiefdoms or integrate with the other races to bring their peerless warcraft
    to the rest of the remnants.\n\n\n**Health -** This character is talented at
    any physical skill. Perception, Athletics, Close Combat, Ranged Combat, Conditioning\n\n**Vitality
    -** When this character loses a Stamina point they roll a 1d10 and on a result
    of 9+ they restore the lost Stamina point.\n\n**Frost Heart -** This character
    is resistant to cold damage. When this character receives cold tokens, they remove
    1 cold intensity at the start of their turn and at the end of their turn.\n\n\n\n\n\n##
    Human\n\n-\n\nAccording to Imperial Scholars of old, humanity is the chosen vessel
    of the gods, burdened with authority and responsibility to educate and civilise
    the lesser races of the world. When the mythical kaiju brought about by the great
    calamity swept the empire off the surface of the world, a lot of the \u2018chosen
    of the divines\u2019 narrative was tossed to the wayside. In truth the remnant
    humans are what their forebears have always been, good at adapting and changing
    with the environment all the while believing that their ability to change their
    surroundings was a one way street.\n\n\n**Fortitude -** Once per day this character
    restores 2 stamina points with a partial rest instead of just 1.\n\n**Tenacity
    -** This character benefits from a +1 bonus to Willpower for the purposes of
    calculating stress.\n\n**Versatility -** Once per partial rest this character
    can turn one Focus, Stamina or Luck point into an Inspiration point.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
    Kobold\n\n-\n\nFor centuries the Kobolds were among the most sworn enemies of
    civilization at large. The small creatures have always sought the control and
    dominance of those they deemed to be superior. This predisposition for loyalty
    has been mistaken for cowardice and complacency by many, the empire was no different.
    After decades of disastrous wars the last emperor had finally convinced the Kobolds
    that he was not a human as they suspected, but he was instead a \u2018dragon\u2019.
    Many within the empire misunderstood the kobold\u2019s penchant to regard the
    emperor as a dragon as bumpkin stupidity. In truth the impossibly loyal Kobald-kin
    that joined the empire were acknowledging strength. This illusion was shattered
    when the empire fell but the Kobolds remained open to the idea that there is
    a place for them among the remnants. One day another dragon will rise and they
    will serve. Who knows, the dragon could be a kobold after all.\n\n\n**Flame Heart
    -** This character is resistant to fire damage. When this character receives
    fire tokens, they remove 1 fire intensity at the start of their turn and at the
    end of their turn.\n\n**Adaptable -** This character needs to consume one half
    of the normal amount of rations.\n\n**Evasive -** This character gains a +1 bonus
    to defence against close combat attacks.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Orc\n\n-\n\nLegend
    says that the demon lords of old have crafted the orc from a pit full of their
    hatred for all decent folk on Katacross. The orcs were a fighting force to be
    reckoned with but they were too unruly and powerful for even the demon lords
    to control and before long the horde split from beneath their demonic controllers
    and staked their own destiny with their own hands. To the empire the orcs were
    a constant justification for their colonisation and encroachment on the other
    nations of the world. The Horde was a relentless and ever present danger. The
    few orcs that had joined the empire brought with them the peerless craft of war,
    weapons, fortifications and all things hostile. After the collapse the orcs found
    a savage world yearning to be tamed by their kind, a challenge most orcs happily
    face.\n\n\n**Constitution -** This character benefits from a +1 bonus to Vigour
    for the purposes of resisting diseases.\n\n**Fury -** When this character performs
    a close combat attack or an attack with a thrown weapon they may spend their
    bonus action to ignore 1 point of a target\u2019s Soak value.\n\n**Potence -**
    This character\u2019s carrying capacity is increased by +50%.\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n##
    Ratfolk\n\n-\n\nThroughout their existence ratfolk have been scapegoated and
    underestimated by their larger peers. Dirty, ignorant, disorganised, disloyal
    and worthless are all words commonly used to describe the Ysoki, and all of these
    words couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Ysoki culture values family above
    everything else, each and every one of them is willing to fight and die for one
    another. Ysoki are extremely fastidious about hygiene, both their personal and
    the small cramped spaces that they like to inhabit. When the Ysoki started to
    integrate with the empire, the older generation bore the brunt of imperial bigotry
    with a smile because they believed that their young would grow up in a world
    ready to accept them. Now that the empire is gone the Ratfolk are concentrating
    on building that better world, empire or not.\n\n\n**Elusive -** This character
    gains a +1 bonus to defence against ranged attacks.\n\n**Attentive -** This character
    gains a +1 bonus to perception score.\n\n**Spirited -** When this character gains
    a Stress point they roll a 1d10 and on a result of 9+ they immediately remove
    it.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Tengu\n\n-\n\nHailing from the corner of the world that
    the empire hadn\u2019t reached yet, the Tengu were always wanderers at heart.
    Within their culture it was their way to fly far and wide across the world to
    gather as much information about it and learn from as many different people as
    possible with the intention to bring back that which they learn to their homelands
    where it can be used to strengthen their country. As the Empire collapsed around
    them the members of the Tengu diaspora that were caught within the calamity were
    forced to live with two ever present horrors. The first was that they would now
    find it impossible to ever go back to their homes. The second was that they would
    never know if the calamity hit their homes or not.\n\n\n**Charm  -** This character
    is talented at any social skill. Persuasion, Intimidation, Insight, Creativity,
    Conviction\n\n**Providence -** When this character loses a Luck point they roll
    a 1d10 and on a result of 9+ they restore the lost Luck point.\n\n**Sky Heart
    -** This character is resistant to shock damage. When this character receives
    shock tokens, they remove 1 shock intensity at the start of their turn and at
    the end of their turn.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n# Skills\n\n)\n-\nCharacters in
    the core system are defined by the skills that they possess. Each skill defines
    a unique facet of a character\u2019s abilities, knowledge and experiences which
    lets them perform actions with more confidence and greater success. Skills come
    in various states of mastery and each level of mastery grants the character greater
    ability with said skill.\n/\n\n\n## Training Level\n\n-\n\n\n**Untrained -**
    A character that is considered to be untrained in a skill has no knowledge about
    this skill and thus is unable to perform it with any level of competence or confidence.
    Untrained skills can still be attempted by a character but characters do so with
    no modifier. Additionally certain actions that depend on such skills will be
    impossible to perform as the lack of knowledge will stop said character from
    being able to even attempt them.\n\n**Trained -** Characters that are trained
    in a skill are learned in its ways and have knowledge of the theory and practice
    of said skills and are usually able to not only perform it but also explain it.
    When a character attempts to perform any action that they are trained in they
    benefit from a +1 modifier.\n\n**Expert -** Characters that are experts in a
    skill have a deep knowledge and understanding behind every action taken and are
    considered to be on their way to mastering it. When a character attempts to perform
    any action that they are expert in they benefit from a +2 modifier.\n\n**Master
    -** Characters that are masters at a skill have achieved a level of knowledge
    that few among their peers will ever possess. When a character attempts to perform
    any action that they are masters in they benefit from a +3 modifier.\n\n**Legend
    -** Characters that are legendary in a skill are so few and far in between that
    literal songs and stories are written about them. When a character attempts to
    perform any action that they are legendary in they benefit from a +4 modifier.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Natural Talent\n\n-\n\n\n**Deficient -** Characters that are deficient in a particular
    skill aren\u2019t simply incapable of performing it, they are so talentless and
    clumsy that any attempts usually result in disaster. When a character attempts
    to perform any action that they are deficient in they suffer from a hindrance.\n\n**Talented
    -** Characters are sometimes naturally gifted in a particular skill and are capable
    of performing it formidably even despite lack of training with impressive results.
    When a character attempts to perform any action that they are talented in, they
    benefit from a boost.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Perception\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs
    how in tune a character is with their natural senses, be they seeing, hearing
    or otherwise.\n\n\n\n## Athletics\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character's ability
    to move along with their flexibility, speed, dexterity and agility. Athletics
    is used to determine a character\u2019s movement speed through the acquisition
    of movement points.\n\n\n\n## Close Combat\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a characters
    ability to throw a punch with the best of them, their skill in using melee weapons
    and effectively use shields in a combat situation.\n\n\n\n## Ranged Combat\n\n-\n\nThis
    skill governs a characters ability to bring ranged weapons to bear, be they bows,
    crossbows, slings, thrown weapons such as javelins or spears or even firearms.\n\n\n\n##
    Conditioning\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s ability to roll with
    the punches and keep going after that they have taken damage.\n\n\n### Wearing
    Armour\nThe conditioning skill is used in tandem with suits of armour as their
    governing skill. When an armour\u2019s ability requires training, refer to the
    conditioning skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Persuasion\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s
    ability to manipulate the attitudes and moods of other characters, leveraging
    their social skills.\n\n### Manipulate\n\nWhen a character uses their persuasion
    skill they are negotiating with a target\u2019s moral integrity looking for chinks
    in their values and driving them to act in their favor. When a character uses
    theri persuasion skill they make a skill dice roll against a difficulty equal
    to their target\u2019s willpower. \n\nIf a character scores a dice roll result
    equal to their target\u2019s willpower they get a marginal success. They are
    able to get the character to act favourably towards them but often with a catch
    or string attached.\n\n|\n\nIf the dice roll excerpts the target\u2019s willpower
    the degree by which this value is exceeded describes how effective the persuasion
    is. Highly effective persuasion can get a character to continue acting in someone's
    favour for longer or grant additional value that the character hadn\u2019t asked
    for.\n\n### Persuasion Modifiers\n\n**Self Preservation -** While characters
    can be manipulated into acting against their best interests if the consequences
    of a course of actions is immediately obviously detrimental, persuasion becomes
    more and more difficult. A target\u2019s willpower score benefits from a +1,
    +2 or +3 bonus depending on how obviously negative these consequences are.\n\n**Alliance
    and Hostility -** Characters that are allied or hostile have a circumstantial
    bonus or penalty to their willpower when dealing with persuasion. A modifier
    of plus or minus 1 or 2 is applied depending on how closely allied or intensely
    hostile a character is. Hostile characters gain a bonus to willpower while allied
    characters suffer a penalty due to their inherent trust.\n\n**Authority and Class
    -** Characters that are in a higher rung of societal privilege have less to fear
    those they deem to be beneath them in most circumstances. A character will benefit
    from a bonus to willpower against persuasion coming from a member of lower class
    or authority. Depending on the context these bonuses can be +1 or +2.\n\n\n\n##
    Intimidation\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s ability to instill
    the fear of death, injury or intense discomfort into those foolish enough to
    elicit their fury.\n\n### Coerce\n\nWhen a character uses their intimidation
    skill they are confronting a target\u2019s courage and zeal. Make a skill dice
    roll against a difficulty equal to their target\u2019s willpower. On a successful
    dice roll the target gains a number of stress points equal to the margin of success.\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
    Insight\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s ability to read between
    the lines, understand the unsaid and perceive the hidden agendas and angles of
    those who interact with them or at least interact around them.\n\n### Discern\n\nA
    character can use their insight against a target\u2019s willpower to read their
    mood or detect signs of duplicity or equivocation. While a character cannot outright
    detect if someone is lying they can detect nervousness, fear, lust or concern
    when they are interacting. Like in persuasion a character who scored a skill
    dice roll result equal to their target\u2019s willpower gains a marginal success,
    benign only able to discern surface emotions. Scoring more than a target\u2019s
    willpower can give deeper insights such as:\n\n- **Ulterior Motives -** Characters
    that are eager to offer deals that are too good to be true or that are willing
    to part with goods and services for little in return are not always desperate
    and something else can be afoot. An insightful character can detect if perhaps
    there is hostile intention or the dishonesty on display is coming from an external
    source (character could be coerced into acting in certain ways and not of their
    own volition).\n\n- **Equivocation, Omission and Duplicity -** Lies or unlikely
    stories can usually be detected because their logic inherently doesn\u2019t hold
    water under careful scrutiny. More often than not a good liar will throw in a
    dash of truth, but a keen observer will know that there\u2019s more to the story
    and there is a difference between someone who doesn\u2019t know better and someone
    who doesn\u2019t want to share everything.\n\n- **Politics and Relationships
    -** Be they big or small the foibles of interpersonal relationships in all societal
    arenas lead individuals to behave irrationally and have less than ideal ambitions.
    An insightful character is more capable of understanding these intricacies based
    on what others say and how others act, especially in front of their peers.\n\n\n\n##
    Creativity\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a characters artistic and creative abilities,
    be they oration, singing, dancing, writing, drawing, playing musical instruments,
    preparing meals, giving speeches or any imaginable form of entertainment.\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Conviction\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character\u2019s willingness to stick
    to their principles and hold their ground when their values are challenged. Characters
    with high conviction aren\u2019t easily swayed, corrupted or dissuaded from theri
    course of action, for good or ill.\n\n\n### Willpower\nCharacters have a willpower
    score which they use to defend against manipulation, seduction, coercion and
    corruption. A character\u2019s willpower is determined by the character\u2019s
    conviction. A character\u2019s willpower is equal to 6 + the character\u2019s
    conviction skill modifier. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Academics\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs
    a character\u2019s knowledge, learned and applied and the character\u2019s capability
    to bring the full power of said knowledge to bear.\n\n### Research\n\nCharacters
    can use their academic knowledge to produce a work, a product or research that
    is tied to their area of study. A character rolls their academics skill dice
    roll against a difficulty value of 6 and they score a number of craft points
    with their action equal to the dice roll result -5. These craft points determine
    the ultimate value of the finished product. Depending on the area of study different
    products can be produced such as:\n\n- Legal defences or cases built towards
    convicting someone. Alternatively new laws can be penned to be proposed.\n\n-
    Theological treatises and philosophies can revolutionise the interpretation of
    divine events which can spawn offshoot cults, new sects or upend whole swathes
    of faithful.\n\n- From propaganda to social engineering to simple marketing projects,
    a deep knowledge of history and society can let those in the know manipulate
    the masses.\n\n- Both foreign and domestic strategies and policies begin with
    a deep analysis of countries, nations, empires and communities.\n\n- Scientific
    theorems, patents, inventions and processes all require a deep understanding
    of the scientific and engineering concepts behind them.\n\n\n\n## Crafting\n\n-\n\nThis
    skill governs a character\u2019s ability to manufacture items with their hands,
    materials and tools. Characters with the appropriate training and equipment can
    craft any item as long as they have sufficient skill and raw materials.\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
    Spellcasting\n\n-\n\nThis skill governs a character's ability to turn the arcane
    and divine into a weapon, wielding the powers mystic against their foes.\n\n###
    Casting Spells\n\nSpells are actions like any other, performed during specific
    phases of play as per the spell\u2019s description. When a spell targets a creature,
    the target can choose to resist the spell\u2019s effect. If the target is resisting,
    the spellcaster must perform a spellcasting dice roll against a difficulty equal
    to the target\u2019s willpower.\n\n\n\n## Survival\n\n-\n\nThe survival skill
    is a collection of knowledge and practice that allows a character to navigate,
    traverse and understand wild environments.\n\n\n### Forage\nCharacters adept
    in the survival skill can use it to forage for food and drink to sustain themselves.
    Every forage action requires a character to perform a survival skill dice roll
    against a base difficulty of 6 (modified by terrain, weather conditions and scarcity).
    Every action consumes 2 hours of work and on a success it will yield 1 day\u2019s
    worth of rations for one person. A critical success yields double the amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n##
    Stealth\n\n-\n\nThe stealth skill is possessed by characters who are adept at
    blending in, be it with the shadows, crowds or chaos. With the stealth skill
    a character can pass by unseen, pilfer things surreptitiously or even plant dangerous
    items without the recipient\u2019s knowledge.\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n# Professions\n\n)\n-\n/\n\n\n##
    Navigation\n\n-\n\nThe Navigation Profession allows characters to act as pathfinders
    and wayfarers, guiding their allies through the land, avoiding the worst that
    the terrain has to offer and dodging and sneaking around dangerous predators.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Trailblaze\n##March
    Action\n-\nA navigator can use their skill to find favorable ground, shortcuts,
    safe routes and lead caravans of people to their destinations expeditiously.
    A navigator performs a survival skill dice roll against a difficulty of 6. This
    grants them a number of Pathfinder Points that they can spend on the following
    effects:\n- **Marching Order -** Spend 2 Pathfinder Points to allow the group
    to travel into one extra zone at no penalty.\n- **Far Ranging -** Spend 1 Pathfinder
    Point to roll an additional Discovery dice roll when entering the new zone.\n-
    **Covert Expedition -** Spend 1 Pathfinder Point to reduce the danger level of
    the zone by 1 for the purposes of the dangerous encounter dice roll.\n- **Resource
    Gathering -** Spend 1 Pathfinder Point to grant a boost to all foraging and hunting
    dice rolls performed.\n\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Recon\n##1 Hour\n-\nA navigator
    can use their skill to scout out and plan an attack, ambush or defend against
    one, armed with the foreknowledge that they manage to gather. A navigator performs
    a survival skill dice roll against a difficulty of 6. This grants them a number
    of recon points that they can spend on the following effects:\n- **Tag Enemy
    -** Tag a single enemy or a small group of up to 3. Attacks performed against
    these enemies during the first turn are boosted.\n- **Favourable Defence -**
    Assign an area within the battlefield 5m in diameter. Any allies taking cover
    in that area gain a +1 bonus to their defence.\n- **Approach Dector -** Draw
    a line on the map that is up to 10 meters long. Any allies performint movement
    actions anywhere within 5m of that line gain an additional 3 movement points.\n-
    **Battle Plan -** Designate an ally within the group. That ally gains a recon
    point and may spend it at any time during the battle to gain an additional +2
    action points.\n\n)\n\n/\n\n\n\n## Medicine\n\n-\n\nThe medicine Profession allows
    characters to treat wounds, prevent infections and promote the natural healing
    of injury. A character that possesses the medicine Profession can use medical
    tools and supplies to perform first aid and surgery.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#First
    Aid\n##Camp (5 Minutes)\n-\n###Survival or Academics Skill vs Difficulty 6\nA
    character with the medicine Profession can perform first aid to patch up a character
    and stop any blood loss. A character can use either the Academics or the Survival
    skills in order to perform the first aid action as long as they are trained in
    one of these skills. A character must have a first aid kit or similar tools in
    order to perform this action. A character rolls a skill dice roll against a difficulty
    of 6 and reduces the intensity of the bloodloss by the margin of the dice roll\u2019s
    success. If the intensity falls below 1, the bloodloss stops. A character takes
    5 minutes to perform first aid and can do so multiple times until all bloodloss
    is stopped.\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Treat Wounds\n##Camp (30 Minutes)\n-\n###Survival
    or Academics Skill vs Difficulty 6\nA character with the medicine Profession
    can treat wounds in order to prevent the spreading of infection. A character
    can use either the Academics or the Survival skills in order to perform the treat
    wounds action as long as they are trained in one of these skills. The recipient
    of the treat wounds action must be performing a full rest in order to receive
    the benefits of this action. A character rolls a skill dice roll against a difficulty
    of 6 and reduces the intensity of the infection by the margin of the dice roll\u2019s
    success. If the intensity falls below 1, the infection stops. A character takes
    30 minutes to treat wounds and can do so once per long rest. Even if an infection
    isn\u2019t removed, if the wounds are treated the infection\u2019s spread slows
    down to +1 intensity per 5 hours.\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Hunting & Foraging\n\n-\n\nThe
    hunting and foraging Profession allows a character to effectively find, identify
    and procure rations from the nature that surrounds them allowing them to provide
    for themselves and allies.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Passive Foraging\n##March Action\n-\n###Automatic\nDuring
    travel a character with the foraging Profession can collect berries, nuts, fruits,
    mushrooms and anything halfway edible. For every march action that a character
    performs they may add 1 day\u2019s worth of food and drink to their supplies.
    This counts as a marching action and thus a character performing passive foraging
    may not perform any other marching actions.\n)\n\n\nnote(\n#Active Foraging\n##Camp
    (2 Hours)\n-\n###Survival Skill vs Difficulty 6\nA character can forage actively
    within an area by spending 2 hours looking for food and fresh clean water. A
    character performing active foraging rolls a survival skill dice roll against
    a difficulty of 6. For every margin of success they manage to gather enough food
    and drink 1 character or creature.\n)\n\n\nnote(\n#Small Game Hunting\n##Camp
    (2 Hours)\n-\n###Survival Survival Skill vs Difficulty 8 vs Difficulty 6\nCharacters
    can hunt for small game if they have the proper tools. Whether they are using
    traps, spears or bows, characters can spend 2 hours chasing small game by performing
    a survival skill dice roll against a difficulty of 8. For every margin of success
    they catch one ENC 2 or smaller creature, providing both food and any materials
    such as hides.\n)\n\n|\n\n\n### Big Game Hunting\nLarge and dangerous creatures
    can be stalked and preyed upon by a skilled hunter. If a character is traveling
    within the territory of such creatures they can use their survival skill to locate
    and track down these mighty beasts. \n\n\n\n\nnote(\n#Locate\n##Camp (1 Hour)\n-\n###Survival
    Skill vs Difficulty 6\nCharacters can spend an hour looking for signs of the
    presence of big game within an area. This action cannot be performed while marching.
    A character performs a survival skill dice roll against a difficulty of 6 in
    order to locate a number of creatures who either consider the terrain as their
    territory or migratory route.The maximum number of creatures located is equal
    to or less than the dice roll\u2019s margin of success.\n)\n\n\nnote(\n#Track\n##1
    Round\n-\n###Survival Skill vs Difficulty 6\nCharacters that successfully locate
    the presence of a creature can choose to pursue it by tracking it down to where
    it currently resides. A character performs a survival skill dice roll against
    a difficulty of 6 to gain a number of tracking points equal to the margin of
    success of the dice roll. They may spend these tracking points to determine one
    or more of the following:\n- The route to take to reach the creature\n- The approximate
    distance that there currently is between them and the creature\n- The current
    behaviour of the creature (seeking food, seeking shelter, etc...)\n- The current
    status of the creature (recently fed, tired, seeking mate, etc...)\n\nOnce a
    character reaches such a creature, normal combat is used to determine the outcome
    of the hunt.\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Taming & Training\n\n-\n\nThe taming and training
    Profession allows characters to cultivate animal companions to join them in their
    travels and perform tasks for them. A well trained pet can be invaluable in most
    situations.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Tame\n##5 Minutes\n-\n###Survival Skill vs Target's
    willpower\nCharacters can attempt to tame a wild beast by approaching it and
    attempting to befriend it. This is of course dangerous in the best of circumstances
    and a character that fails in their attempt is probably going ot be faced with
    an ornery wild animal. On a successful dice roll a character manages to befriend
    the animal get it to trust and follow them but the animal is not yet trained.
    The following is a list of modifiers that can apply for the taming action:\n-

    to perform any one of their tricks during their turn by spending an action point.
    The target creature must be within line of sight and hearing range to receive
    the command. Multiple tricks can be assigned within a turn to perform multiple
    commands however a creature is still limited by its own action points and creatures
    commanded this way must always act after their handler.\n)\n\n/\n\n\nitem(\n#Follow\n##Complexity

    from a boost on actions to track targets.\n)\nitem(\n#Heel\n##Complexity 30\n-\nCreatures
    can be trained for war and hostile situations, preparing them for when danger
    arises. A creature that received heel training no longer panics in combat and
    can still take commands from their owner.\n)\n=\nitem(\n#Attack\n##Complexity
    50\n-\nCreatures can be trained for proper combat, letting them loose on enemies
    to unleash their wild fury. A character can spend their bonus action to assign
    a target to their animal companion. The animal companion will attack their target
    and keep attacking it until their target is dear or it is called off.\n)\nitem(\n#Summon\n##Complexity
    30\n-\nThis animal is trained to roam close to its master while staying out of
    sight and harm\u2019s way. While in the wilds (or a suitably animal friendly
    environment) the animal can be summoned to its master with an audible call. The
    animal joins the encounter at the end of the master\u2019s turn.\n)\nitem(\n#Home\n##Complexity

    30\n-\nThis animal is trained in performing simple tasks such as pulling, pushing,
    picking up objects, placing, lifting, dropping or even opening and closing doors
    on command. Interactions can never be complex, require the creature to perform
    multiple specific movements in a row (such as pushing a key into a lock and turning
    it correctly) and are limited to simple actions (such as pulling down a door
    handle and pushing it open thereafter).\n)\n|\nitem(\n#Threaten\n##Complexity

    herbalism & brewing Profession trains a character in the creation of potions
    and concoctions. The herbalism portion of the knowledge empowers a character
    with the ability to recognize components in the flora and fauna around them letting
    characters extract materials from the environment.\n\n/\n\n\n### Components\nCharacters
    need to gather a different variety of components in order to brew herbalist solutions.
    These are reagents and mutagens. Each type of component can create different
    categories of solutions.\n\n### Toxicity\nA character that consumes solutions
    suffers from a number of toxicity points for each solution consumed. If a character\u2019s
    toxicity value is equal to or greater than the character\u2019s vigour, the character
    falls unconscious until the toxicity value is reduced. A character that receives
    a full rest reduces their toxicity by 1.\n\n### Recipes\nA character that wishes
    to brew a solution must have the recipe in their repertoire. A character that
    chooses this Profession immediately starts with 1 recipe of their choice. From
    there on a character must either discover recipes in the world, learn them from
    mentors or spend time and resources experimenting to create them, themself. Each
    individual recipe allows a character to learn a different effect for either Reagent
    Salves or Mutagenic Elixirs.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Gathering Components\n##Camp
    2 Hour or March\n-\n###Academics Skill vs Difficulty 6 (Reagent), Academics Skill
    vs Difficulty 8 (Mutagen)\nA character can spend time gathering resources for
    their brewing. A character can either spend 2 hours to gather resources or do
    so during a march as a marching action. Every time that a character performs
    a gathering components action they may roll a skill dice roll based on Academics
    in order to gather reagents or mutagens. Gathering reagents is done at a difficulty
    of 6 and mutagens is done at a difficulty of 8. Each successful dice roll results
    in a character gathering enough resources for 1 solution. Components decay after
    a day if they are not used.\n)\n\n\nnote(\n#Brewing\n##Camp 15 Minutes\n-\n###Crafting
    Skill vs Difficulty 6\nA character can brew a solution if they have a brewing
    kit and access to open flames. Brewing a solution takes 15 minutes and consumes
    1 unit of the appropriate component. Based on a character\u2019s crafting skill
    dice roll result a solution with an intensity value can be created. The intensity
    value is equal to the dice roll\u2019s margin of success.\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\nitem(\n#Reagent
    Salve\n-\nA reagent salve is designed to aid the body to heal. Salves are consumed
    by characters as bonus action and each salve that a character consumes causes
    the character to receive 1 point of toxicity. An alchemist\u2019s salve has an
    intensity value that is used to determine how strong its effect is. A salve can
    have any one of the following effects:\n- **Coagulation [X] -** Reduce a target
    character\u2019s blood loss intensity by an amount equal to X\n- **Cleansing
    [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s infection intensity by an amount equal
    to X.\n- **Purification [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s poison intensity
    by an amount equal to X.\n- **Fortification [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s
    disease intensity by an amount equal to X.\n\n)\nitem(\n#Mutagenic Elixir\n-\nA
    mutagenic elixir is a body booster that grants a character a temporary enhancement
    on their natural ability. Elixirs are consumed by characters as bonus actions
    and each elixir that a character consumes causes the character to receive X points
    of toxicity as noted in the braces. An elixir can have any one of the following
    effects:\n- **Awareness [2] -** Character gains a boost to perception dice rolls
    and  a +10% bonus to perception range per elixir intensity.\n- **Speed [2] -**
    Character gains a number of bonus movement points per turn equal to the elixir\u2019s
    intensity.\n- **Haste [2] -** Character gains a number of haste tokens equal
    to the elixir\u2019s intensity. The character may spend one haste token at the
    start of a turn in order to gain an additional bonus action. Any unspent haste
    tokens are lost if a character rests.\n- **Might [2] -** Character gains a number
    of might tokens equal to the elixir\u2019s intensity. The character may spend
    one might token at the start of a turn in order to gain a +1 bonus to close combat
    attack damage. Any unspent might tokens are lost if a character rests.\n- **Endurance

    Alchemy\n\n-\n\nThe Alchemy Profession allows a character to come up with and
    bring to bear dangerous toxic solutions and explosive concoctions.\n\n/\n\n\n###
    Components\nCharacters need to gather a different variety of components in order
    to create alchemical solutions. These are toxins and combustibles. Each type
    of component can create different categories of solutions.\n\n### Recipes\nA
    character that wishes to mix a solution must have the recipe in their repertoire.
    A character that chooses this Profession immediately starts with 1 recipe of
    their choice. From there on a character must either discover recipes in the world,
    learn them from mentors or spend time and resources experimenting to create them,
    themself. Each individual recipe allows a character to learn a different effect
    for either Reagent Salves or Mutagenic Elixirs.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Gathering
    Components\n##Camp 2 Hour or March\n-\n###Academics Skill vs Difficulty 6 (Toxin),
    Academics Skill vs Difficulty 8 (Combustible)\nA character can spend time gathering
    resources for their brewing. A character can either spend 2 hours to gather resources
    or do so during a march as a marching action. Every time that a character performs
    a gathering components action they may roll a skill dice roll based on Academics
    in order to gather toxins or combustibles. Gathering toxins is done at a difficulty
    of 6 and combustibles is done at a difficulty of 8. Each successful dice roll
    results in a character gathering enough resources for 1 solution. Components
    decay after a day if they are not used.\n)\n\n\nnote(\n#Mixing\n##Camp 15 Minutes\n-\n###Crafting
    Skill vs Difficulty 6\nA character can mix a solution if they have a mixing kit
    and access to open flames. Mixing a solution takes 15 minutes and consumes 1
    unit of the appropriate component. Based on a character\u2019s crafting skill
    dice roll result a solution with an intensity value can be created. The intensity
    value is equal to the dice roll\u2019s margin of success.\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\nitem(\n#Toxin
    Coating\n-\nToxin coatings are poured over weapons in order to impart harmful
    effects on targets. Applying a toxin coating on a weapon is a bonus action. A
    weapon that is coated with a toxin will impart its effect on the weapon\u2019s
    next attack after which the coating\u2019s effect is lost. A weapon can only
    ever have one coating on it, the last one that it received.  A coating has an
    intensity value that is used to determine how strong its effect is. A coating
    will inflict a number of toxin effects on a target equal to the coating\u2019s
    intensity value.  A coating can have any one of the following effects:\n- **Paralysis
    [X] -** Targets suffer from a penalty to movement points equal to X. If X is
    equal to or greater than the target\u2019s vigour, the target is slowed. A slowed
    target gains half of their action points.\n- **Enervation [X] -** Targets suffer
    from a hindrance to all actions. If X equal to or greater than the target\u2019s
    vigour, the target suffers from a -1 penalty to all close combat damage.\n- **Deprivation
    [X] -** Targets suffer from a penalty to initiative equal to X.\n- **Agitation
    [X] -** Targets suffer from a number of stress points equal to X.\n- **Infection
    [X] -** Targets suffer from a number of infection points equal to X.\n\n)\nitem(\n#Armour
    Coating\n-\n Armour coatings are special oils poured and smeared over armour
    and gear in order to impart beneficial and protective effects on the wearer and
    the item. An armour that is coated will retain its beneficial effects until the
    effects are depleted, the item is cleaned or a new coating is added on top of
    the old one. Any item can only ever benefit from one coating at a time. A coating
    can have any one of the following effects:\n- **Fire Retardant -** The wearer
    of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points of fire
    intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n- **Anti-Freeze
    -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first 3
    points of cold intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n-
    **Grounding -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove
    the first 3 points of shock intensity that they receive after which the coating
    is removed.\n- **Lubricant -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating
    will remove the first 3 points of tangle intensity that they receive after which
    the coating is removed.\n- **Alkalene -** The wearer of an armour treated with
    this coating will remove the first 3 points of corrosion intensity that they
    receive after which the coating is removed.\n\n)\nitem(\n#Combustible Petard\n-\nCombustible
    Petards are small handheld improvised explosive devices that can teach an unwitting
    opponent a hard lesson about bullying chemistry nerds. Igniting and throwing
    a Combustible petard takes 2 attack action points, one to ignite and one to throw.
    A character can use a bonus action to ignite if they so choose. A petard has
    an intensity value that is used to determine how many different effects it has.
    A petard can have any combination of the following effects:\n- **Intensity -**
    Increase the explosion\u2019s damage by +1 per effect.\n- **Blast Radius -**
    Grant the explosion a splash effect of 1m per effect.\n- **Shrapnel -** Grant
    the explosion the pierce and slash effects.\n- **Concussion -** Grant the explosion
    the push and slam effects.\n- **Incendiary -** The explosion inflicts 2 fire
    tokens per effect.\n- **Cryostasis -** The explosion inflicts 2 cold tokens per
    effect.\n- **Electrostatic -** The explosion inflicts 2 shock tokens per effect.\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
    Crafter\n\n-\n\n\n### Gunsmithing\nThe gunsmithing Profession allows a character
    to create and maintain all forms of firearms, cannons and their ammunition. As
    firearm designs become more intricate, components more precise and ammunition
    more deadly, so do their crafters have to become more masterful in their art.\n\n###
    Blacksmithing\nThe blacksmithing Profession allows a character to become an expert
    in metallurgy, fogging or ores and beating of metal to shape it into tools, weapons,
    armours, utensils, jewellery and any form of metallic reinforcement.\n\n### Leatherworking
    & Tailoring\nThe leatherworking and tailoring Profession deals with all forms
    of soft fabric crafting, harvesting and refining technique. With leatherworking
    & tailoring a character can not only create all forms of clothing and various
    armour but also extract, harvest and refine hides, leathers, linens, cottons,
    wools, furs and all forms of natural fibres.\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nitem(\n#Rarity & Requirements\n-\nEvery
    item in the game belongs to a rarity category. The four rarity categories are
    Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary. In order for a character to be able to
    repair, maintain, scavenge, craft or upgrade any item they must possess a skill
    level in their crafting skill that is equal to or greater than the item rarity
    rating. The rarity ratings are as follows:\n- **Common -** Rarity Rating 1, Trained
    Skill Level\n- **Uncommon -** Rarity Rating 2, Expert Skill Level\n- **Rare -**
    Rarity Rating 3, Master Skill Level\n- **Legendary -** Rarity Rating 4, Legend
    Skill Level\n\n)\n\n\nitem(\n#Raw Materials\n-\nItems need an amount of raw materials
    in order to be created. Each raw material has a type and a rarity value. Wood,
    Metal, Leather, Fabric are all examples of types. The rarity level needs to match
    the rarity of the item being created. For example a Longsword is an Uncommon
    Metal Weapon with an ENC of 1 so a crafter needs 1 ENC of Uncommon Metal in order
    to craft it.\nPerforming repairs and upgrades also need raw materials, just less
    of them. Each repair and upgrade performed takes 1 unit of raw material (1 ENC)
    of the appropriate type.\n)\n\n|\n\n\nitem(\n#Tools\n-\nWhether a character is
    crafting, repairing, upgrading or scavenging, they can only do so if they have
    prerequisite tools in their possession. Repairs and scavenging can be done with
    portable tool kits while crafting and upgrading require workshops and crafting
    stations.\n)\n\n\nitem(\n#Crafting Time\n-\nEvery item that is created takes
    an amount of crafting time. This is calculated as a crafting time value which
    is equal to the item\u2019s ENC (min 1) x its rarity rating. Every time that
    a character spends 2 hours on a crafting action they must roll a crafting skill
    dice roll against a difficulty of 6 and the margin of success of this dice roll
    is added towards a total progress in the crafting of the item. Once the progress
    value is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete.\nRegardless of the
    crafting complexity each repair action takes 2 hours to perform.\nUpgrade actions
    take one half of an item's crafting complexity.\n)\n\n/\n\n=\n\n### Blueprints\n\nCharacters
    who have training in the Craft skill are able to craft any common item. For Uncommon
    items or rarer, they need to acquire a blueprint or create it by themself. In
    order for a character to create a blueprint from scratch they must perform a
    crafting action that consumes 5 times the normal amount of time and raw materials.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Craft\n##Camp
    2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting Skill vs Difficulty 6\nCharacters withthe appropriate
    crafting profession can craft different item types. Blacksmiths can craft weapons
    and heavy armour. Leatherworkers and taiors can craft gear items and light and
    medium armour. Gunsmiths can craft firearms and ammunition.\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Repair\n##Camp
    2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting Skill vs Difficulty 6\nItems that are broken, damaged
    or otherwise rendered inoperable can be repaired to restore them to their normal
    functionality. A repair action is the same as a crafting action, i.e. a crafting
    skill dice roll that consumes 2 hours. Unlike crafting however, repairs do not
    consume raw materials, but impose all other restrictions (i.e. a character must
    have the prerequisite skills to craft an item in order to be able to repair it).\n)\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Scavenge\n##Camp
    2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting Skill vs Difficulty 6\nItems can be broken down into
    their components in order to recover some raw materials from them. When doing
    so the quality of the materials deteriorates as a consequence of scavenging.
    The amount of Raw materials scavenged in ENC is the same as the ENC of the item
    but the quality of raw material is one rating less than the item's rarity (to
    a minimum of 1, Common). For example Scavenging a rare item of ENC 3 yields ENC
    3 worth of uncommon materials.)\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Upgrade\n##Camp 2 Hours\n-\n###Crafting
    Skill vs Difficulty 6\nItems can receive one or more upgrades after that they
    are crafted. Each item can receive any upgrade that applies to its item type
    and may receive multiple upgrades on it if the crafter has enough skill however
    items can never receive the same upgrade more than once unless otherwise specified.
    An item can receive up to 4 different upgrades but a crafter must have an appropriate
    skill level to apply the second, thrid or fourth upgrade.\nThe number of upgrades
    that a character can apply on a single item is limited by the character\u2019s
    skill modifier in crafting. For example a character who is a master in this skill
    can add up to 3 different upgrades on the same item.\n)\n\n=\n\n\nitem(\n#Melee

    & Rune Crafting\n\n-\n\nThe talisman making profession allows a character to
    create magical trinkets which can grant temporary power to their wielders, be
    they in the form of small charms or inscribed insignias and tattoos.\n\nThe runecrafting
    making profession allows a character to create wondrous items which can grant
    permanent power to their wielders in the form of enchanted objects.\n\n/\n\n\nnote(\n#Crafting
    Talismans\n-\nCharacters with both the spellcasting skill and the crafting skill
    can craft talismans by imbuing seemingly mundane objects with mana essence. Depending
    on the rarity of the talisman a different amount of mana essence needs to be
    consumed. The crafting skill requirements for each talisman needs to be met by
    both the crafting skill and the spellcasting skill. The following lists the amount
    of mana essence per talisman:\n- **Common -** 1 Mana essence, Craft Time 2\n-
    **Uncommon -** 1 Mana essence, Craft Time 3\n- **Rare -** 2 Mana essence, Craft
    Time 4\n- **Legendary -** 3 Mana essence, Craft Time 5\n\n)\n\n|\n\n\nnote(\n#Rune
    Crafting\n-\nCharacters with both the spellcasting skill and the crafting skill
    can craft runes by imbuing symbols transcribed onto objects with mana essence.
    Depending on the rarity of the rune a different amount of mana essence needs
    to be consumed. The crafting skill requirements for each rune needs to be met
    by both the crafting skill and the spellcasting skill. The following lists the
    amount of mana essence per rune:\n- **Common -** 5 Mana essence, Craft Time 10\n-
    **Uncommon -** 10 Mana essence, Craft Time 15\n- **Rare -** 20 Mana essence,
    Craft Time 30\n- **Legendary -** 30 Mana essence, Craft Time 45\n\nThe number
    of runes that a character can transcribe on a single item is limited by the character\u2019s
    skill modifier in both crafting and spellcasting. A character who is a master
    in both these skills can add up to 3 different runes on the same item. Regardless
    of skill levels no rune may be placed on an item more than once.\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n#
    Fuels\n\n)\n-\nIn addition to stats, characters have three fuel gauges that they
    can use to aid them in their adventures. Each fuel is unique in both how it is
    gained and restored and how it is applied. The three fuels are Stamina, Luck
    and Focus.\n/\n\n\n## Stamina\n\n-\n\nStamina is a gauge of a character\u2019s
    fitness and current vigor and it is restored by resting. A character that performs
    a partial rest (one hour) restores 1 lost Stamina point. Stamina is used to fuel
    certain talents which allow characters to perform incredible feats.\n\n\n###
    Maximum Stamina\nTo calculate the maximum stamina of a character, choose the
    highest grade of physical skill that the character has (Perception, Athletics,
    Close Combat, Ranged Combat, Contitioning). The maximum stamina is equal to the
    highest skill modifier +1.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Focus\n\n-\n\nFocus measures the
    overall mental faculties of a character as the cumulative pressure and mental
    strain puts a limit to how many feats of mental prowess they can perform. A character
    that performs a partial rest (one hour) restores 1 lost Focus point.  Focus is
    used to fuel certain talents which allow characters to perform incredible feats.\n\n\n###
    Maximum Focus\nTo calculate the maximum focus of a character, choose the highest
    grade of mental skill that the character has (Academics, Profession, Spellcasting,
    Survival, Concentration).The maximum focus is equal to the highest skill modifier
    +1.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Luck\n\n-\n\nLuck is a measure of a character\u2019s gumption,
    their instinct to capitalize on every opportunity they observe, their willingness
    to seize the moment and everything else which is out of their control. Even though
    some are blessed by the goddess of luck, everybody's good fortune runs out eventually.
    A character\u2019s luck is restored fully whenever they gain an advancement during
    their adventure. Each luck point can be spent to dramatically alter the course
    of the destiny of a character. By spending a luck point a character can change
    the result of a dice roll to whatever number they want. The dice roll must be
    for an action that they themself are doing, or an action that is targeting them
    directly. \n\n\n### Maximum Luck\nTo calculate the maximum luck of a character,
    choose the highest grade of social skill that the character has (Persuasion,
    Intimidation, Insight, Performance, Conviction). The maximum luck is equal to
    the highest skill modifier +1.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n# Combat\n\n)\n-\n/\n\n\n##
    Time\n\n-\n\nWhen a hostile situation arises time is calculated differently than
    during exploration. The passage of time is divided into Scenes, Rounds, Turns
    and Actions. A Scene lasts as long as the hostility lasts and once the combat
    is resolved the scene is considered to be over. Effects that last until the end
    of the scene, will stop taking effect after the scene is over.\n\n\n### Round\nA
    combat round lasts until every participant in the combat has had their turn.
    Note that if a participant is rendered incapable of acting, their turn ends automatically
    when it starts.\n\n### Turn\nA turn generally lasts around 6 seconds in real
    time and each turn one participant, in order of initiative, may perform their
    actions. At the start of a player's turn their character gains a number of action
    points with which to perform individual actions.\n\n### Action\nAn action lasts
    until it is resolved. Each action costs 1 or more action points but one action
    may allow a character to perform multiple things at once such as actions that
    grant multiple attacks or movement which allows a character to perform several
    different movements types as long as they have movement points to spend. \n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Action Points\n\n-\n\nAt the start of every character's turn, they gain a number
    of action points to spend on performing actions. Each character always receives
    a number of action points equal to 1 + their highest skill modifier. Most actions
    cost 1 action point to perform and a character can spend any combination of actions
    in any order as long as all actions are performed within their turn and they
    spend their alloted action points and not more.\n\nCharacters can choose to not
    spend any amount of action points, leaving 'open' action points in reserve in
    order to perform certain types of actions that can be performed during another
    character's turn. These are called reactions and they cover things like parrying
    attacks or standing in overwatch.\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Initiative Phase\n\n-\n\nAt
    the beginning of a round of combat all participants that are aware of danger
    perform an initiative dice roll which is rolling 1d10 + the character\u2019s
    initiative modifier (calculated by taking the character's perception skill value
    + any additional bonuses from traits, and talents and gear). The results of character\u2019s
    initiatives are used to tally the order in which participants take turns at performing
    actions.\n\n\n### Initiative Score\nCharacters use their perception to determine
    their initiative score. A character\u2019s initiative bonus is equal to the character\u2019s
    perception skill modifier. Additional initiative bonuses and penalties are applied
    by circumstance, equipment and talents. Similarly characters that are gifted
    or deficient in perception have boosted or hindered perception dice rolls.\n\n###
    Initiative Actions\nCharacters and creatures benefit from talents and special
    abilities that may be activated during the initiative phase before a combat round
    starts. While performing initiative dice rolls, characters can choose to activate
    one such ability in order to gain its effect. If a character has more than one
    ability that is activated as an initiative action, they must choose which one
    of their initiative abilities they want to choose and may never benefit from
    more than one at a time.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Combat Turn\n\n-\n\nDuring their
    combat turn characters receive a number of movement points, a main action and
    a bonus action to spend on actions that they want to perform during their turn.
    \n\n/\n\n\n\n### Movement Points\n\n-\n\nDuring a character\u2019s turn a character
    that is able to move may spend 1 action point in orer to receive movement points.
    A character can freely spend movement points before, after and during any action
    and in between. \n\nWhen a chracter spends 1 action point to perform movement
    they receive a number of movement points. The number of movement points gained
    is calculated as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**5 + (Athletics skill modifier x2)**\n\n)\n\nA
    character can spend more than 1 action point on movement actions. Each action
    point spent beyond the first adds their Athletics skill modifier x2 again. If
    a character is untrained in Athletics they gain 1 movement point instead.\n\nEach
    movement point spent allows a character to do the following.\n\n- **Hustle -**
    Run 1m per point spent. Walk 1m per 2 points spent to do so stealthily.\n- **Jump
    -** Vault 1m per 2 points spent.\n- **Crawl -** Scurry 1m per 2 points spent.
    This counts as stealthy movement.\n- **Swim -** Paddle 1m per 2 points spent.
    Paddle 1m per 3 points spent to do so stealthily.\n- **Climb -** Scale 1m per
    2 points spent up comfortable surfaces (ladders, knotted ropes, sheer surfaces
    aided by grapple hooks & climbing gear) or 1m per 3 points spent for free climbing.\n-
    **Stand Up -** Standing up from being knocked down costs 3 movement points.\n-
    **Go Prone -** Going down into a prone position takes 1 movement point.\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n###
    Hiding and Sneaking\n\n-\n\nDuring their turn a character can spend their their
    movement points in order to hide or sneak. If a character is currently out of
    line of sight or within a source of cover, concealment or any manner of environment
    that would obscure their presence, they may spend a 2 movement points to hide.
    \n\nA character that performs a hiding action gains a stealth score equal to
    1 + their stealth skill modifier\n\nFrom the moment a character performs such
    actions they are considered to be hidden unless an observer with a perception
    score equal to or higher than their stealth is directly looking at them. \n\nEvery
    action a character performs that is noticeable (such as moving objects, manipulating
    devices or attacking) reduces a character\u2019s stealth score by -1 or -2 depending
    on the circumstance.\n\nA character can gain a +1 bonus to their stealth score
    for every 3 additional movement points they decide to spend on hiding.\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
    Movement Modifiers\n\n-\n\n/\n\n\n**Boosted Movement -** Characters that are
    moving in favour of a powerful current, or who have been given a helping push
    towards a direction benefit from a bonus to their movement. Characters that are
    boosted in such ways double the distances moved per movement point spent..\n\n**Hindered
    Movement -** Characters that are encumbered, hamstrung or attempting to move
    against an overwhelming current or a hindering force suffer from a penalty to
    their movement. Characters that are hindered in such ways half all the distances
    moved per movement point spent.\n\n**Entangled -** Characters that are currently
    caught to webs, ropes, hogtied, or grappled with an opponent may not use movement
    points to perform movement (walk, crawl, climb, swim etc). They may still perform
    other actions, however a lot of actions that require freedom of movement may
    be also hindered by the character being entangled.\n\n**Knocked Down -** Characters
    that have become unbalanced and have been knocked off of their feet must spend
    3 movement points in order to regain balance.\n\n**Prone -** Characters that
    went down to a prone position (not ones that were knocked down) gain a +1 bonus
    to their cover if they were within a source of cover, they gain a cover bonus
    of 1 if they were not previously in cover, and gain a +1 bonus to their stealth
    score. From a prone position a character can only crawl and must stand up before
    being able to do any other type of movement action. Performing attacks from a
    prone position is always hindered.\n\n**Rough Terrain -** Shallow water, thick
    mud, deep sand or snow and uneven rocks all contribute to poorly transmit back
    a creature\u2019s footfall energy. Any form of rough terrain will cause a character
    traversing it to go slower than normal. Generally rough terrain will cause a
    character to suffer from hindered movement.\n\n|\n\n**Slippery Terrain -** Icy
    lakes, wet moss, muddy stone and most tiled sloping roofs are usually quite precarious
    and slippery for anyone attempting to traverse them. In addition to being examples
    of rough terrain, a character moving through one or more meters of slippery terrain
    must perform an athletics dice roll in order to avoid falling prone. The basic
    difficulty is 6 and for every 2 meters traversed within the same movement action
    the difficulty increases by +1.\n\n**Dangerous Terrain -** Dangerous terrain
    defines any environment that is immediately hostile to a character like acid
    pools, magma puddles, flash fires, thorns and brambles and any form of spikes
    and blades jutting out of the environment. In addition to being examples of rough
    terrain a character moving through one or more meters of dangerous terrain must
    perform an athletics dice roll in order to avoid taking a wound. The basic difficulty
    is 6 and for every 2 meters traversed within the same movement action the difficulty
    increases by +1.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Attacking\n\n-\n\nCharacters can perform
    attacks against targets during their combat turn by spending their action points.
    A character can perform both close combat and ranged combat actions within the
    same turn however they must perform a Combat Stance action to switch weapons
    in between attacks.\n\n### Attack Dice Roll\n\n-\n\nrules(\n\n**Close combat
    attack = close combat skill dice roll vs target\u2019s defence**\n\n**Ranged
    combat attack = ranged combat skill dice roll vs difficulty of 6**\n\n)\n\nBoth
    of the above take 1 action point each.\n\n\n\n### Combat Stance\n\n-\n\nThe combat
    stance action allows a character to perform certain actions during a hostile
    situation that would divert their attention away from the enemy, even if temporarily.
    This includes things like drawing a weapon, storing it in its sheath, reloading
    a weapon, retreiving a weapon or ammunition from a pouch or pocket, going down
    into a prone position or standing up from a prone position. Once  a character
    has spent 1 action point on combat stance they may perform any number of these
    actions any number of time as they want until the start of their next turn.\n\n\n\n##
    Attack Modifiers\n\n-\n\n\n**Flanking -** If two or more allied characters are
    attacking the same target and surrounding it in any way that causes any line
    drawn from their occupied squares to cross the target\u2019s occupied square,
    the attackers are considered to be flanking. Flanking attackers benefit from
    boosted attacks.\n\n**Hamstrung -** Characters that are in any way shape or form
    hindered in their movement suffer from a penalty to their defence. If a character
    is suffering from effects that are causing them to lose half of their movement
    points they suffer from a -1 penalty to defence. If a character is suffering
    from effects that are causing them to lose all of their movement points they
    suffer from a -2 penalty to their defence.\n\n**Surprise -** Attacks that come
    from an enemy that a defender is not aware of causes their defence to go down
    to 4. While unaware a character cannot perform reactions.\n\n**Cover -** Characters
    that are within source of cover and concealment are harder to hit and more likely
    to dodge out of incoming fire. The difficulty to hit a character in cover increases
    by +1 for partial cover and +2 for full cover.\n\n**Elevation -** Characters
    that are occupying higher ground are at an advantage as they are able to have
    a better overview of the battlefield. Elevated characters always count as having
    partial cover and can ignore 1 point of a target\u2019s cover.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n##
    Combat Maneuvers\n\n-\n\nIn addition to attacks during a turn a character can
    spend their action points to perform a combat maneuver. A combat maneuver can
    be performed at any time in order to benefit from its effect.\n\n/\n\n\n\n###
    Combat Maneuvers\n\n-\n\n- **Aid -** Grant an ally within 1m a +1 bonus on their
    next attack dice roll. This maneuver can be performed multiple times on the same
    or different allies each time adding an additional +1.\n- **Called Attack -**
    Declare a target zone to gain the following bonuses and penalties to attack:\n-
    **[Arm] -** Suffer from a -1 to attack dice roll and inflict a number of arm
    injury points equal to the margin of success on the dice roll. As long as a creature
    has 1 or more arm injury points they suffer from a hindrance to all attacks made
    with that arm. If the arm injury points are equal to or greater than the creature\u2019s
    vigour an additional hindrance is added.\n- **[Leg] -** Suffer from a -1 to attack
    dice roll and inflict a number of leg injury points equal to the margin of success
    on the dice roll. As long as a creature has 1 or more leg injury points they
    suffer from a -1 penalty to movement points. If the leg injury points are equal
    to or greater than the creature\u2019s vigour the creature suffers from losing
    1/2 of their movement points.\n- **[Head] -** Suffer from a -2 to attack dice
    roll and inflict a number of head injury points equal to the margin of success
    on the dice roll. As long as a creature has 1 or more head injury points they
    suffer from a hindrance to all dice rolls. If the head injury points are equal
    to or greater than the creature\u2019s vigour, that creature falls unconscious.\n-
    **Overwatch -** Declare any set of 4 adjacent squares within line of sight and
    weapon range. Until the start of the next turn, whjen a valid target enters or
    exits any one of those squares, you can perform an attack against that target.
    A character may perform one overwatch reaction attack per action point spent.\n-
    **Overrun -** Perform an athletics dice roll against the defence of an opponent
    whose occupied square you wish to traverse. On a successful dice roll you may
    move through the occupied square as long as you have enough movement to reach
    an empty space.\n- **Protect  -** Grant an ally within 1m a +1 bonus to defence
    against the next attack that targets them directly. This maneuver can be performed
    multiple times on the same or different allies each time adding an additional
    +1.\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Combat Maneuvers\n\n-\n\n- **Disarm -** Perform a close
    combat skill action against a target\u2019s defence. If the margins of success
    exceed the target's attack bonus a held item falls to their feet.\n- **Feint
    -** Perform a close combat skill action against a target's willpower. On a successful
    dice roll the target suffers from a -1 penalty to defence against the next attack
    that targets them.\n- **Grapple -** Perform a close combat skill action against
    a target\u2019s vigour. On  a successful result that target is grappled. Neither
    grappled or grappler may use movement actions (walking, crawling, climbing swimming
    etc) and can only attack each other. A grappled target is considered to be hindered
    when performing attacks.\n- **Parry -** Gain a bonus to defence against the first
    close combat attack that targets you equal to your close combat skill modifier.\n-
    **Push -** Perform a close combat skill action against a target\u2019s vigour.
    On a successful result the target is forcefully moved directly away from you
    a distance equal to 1m for every 2 margins of success.\n- **Trip -** Perform
    a close combat skill action against a target\u2019s vigour. On a successful result
    the target falls prone. Prone characters are hindered when performing movement
    and attack actions and must spend 3 movement points to remove the prone condition.\n-
    **Take Aim -** Reduce the penalties incurred by distance by 1 point for the next
    ranged attack performed.\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Perception Range\n\n-\n\nCharacters
    that are performing actions at a range find more difficulty the farther away
    an object is from their sight.\n\nrules(\n\n**Perception range = 20m + perception
    skill x20m.**\n\n)\n\nA character can perform actions with a target within their
    perception range at no penalty. Every time that the perception range is exceeded,
    a cumulative -1 penalty is applied to the dice roll. For example a character
    with a perception range of 10 will not suffer any penalties for targeting at
    3m, 6m or 10m of distance, they will suffer form a -1 penalty for targeting at
    11m, 17m or 14m of distance and they will suffer from a -2 penalty for targeting
    at 22m, 28m or 30m of distance.\n\n|\n\n\n\n## Perception Score\n\n-\n\nCharacters
    have a passive perception score that allows them to notice things at a distance.
    While nearly everything within the world can be easily seen and understood by
    a character as long as objects are large enough and well illuminated enough,
    a character\u2019s perception score allows them to notice creatures, characters
    and objects that are out of place, suspicious or curious. \n\nrules(\n\n**Perception
    score = perception skill modifier +1**\n\n)\n\nA character suffers from a -1
    penalty to perception for every hindrance that they are suffering from, be it
    distance, darkness, noise etc. Objects that are hidden or characters that are
    hiding have a stealth value depending on how well hidden they are. If a character\u2019s
    perception score is higher than a target\u2019s stealth score, the character
    is aware of the target.\n\n/\n\n\n\n## Defence\n\n-\n\n/\n\nWhen characters are
    targeted by a close combat attack, their attacker performs their skill dice roll
    against a difficulty determined by a character\u2019s defence score. In essence
    a highly trained close combatant is better at dodging, blocking and parrying
    incoming blows. A character\u2019s defence score is as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**6
    + Close combat skill modifier**\n\n)\n\n\n\n## Dealing Damage\n\n-\n\nWhen a
    target has been hit with a successful attack they suffer from damage. The attack\u2019s
    damage value is calculated as such:\n\nrules(\n\n**Attack action margin + weapon
    damage**\n\n)\n\nIf this damage bonus is greater than the target\u2019s soak
    value, the target suffers from a wound.\n\n\n\n### Soak\n\n-\n\nCharacters that
    receive damage have a chance to soak it and brush it off. A character\u2019s
    soak value is calculated as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**1 + ARM value of the armour
    they are wearing**\n\n)\n\n\n\n### Critical Hits\n\n-\n\nWhen an attacker gains
    a critical on their attack dice roll, they may inflict an additional wound beyond
    the first on their attack for every time that the damage exceeds the target\u2019s
    soak.\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Wounds\n\n-\n\nA character\u2019s wounds represent how
    many times they can be seriously hurt in battle before they fall. A character\u2019s
    maximum wounds are calculated as follows:\n\nrules(\n\n**1 + Conditioning skill
    modifier**\n\n)\n\nIf an injured character is 1 wound away from being incapacitated
    they suffer from a -2 penalty to all actions. If an injured character is 2 wounds
    away from being incapacitated they suffer from a -1 penalty to all actions. A
    character\u2019s maximum wounds are equal to 1 + their Conditioning skill modifier.\n\n\n\n###
    Incapacitated, Unconscious and Dead\n\n-\n\nWhen a character or a creature has
    suffered from a number of wounds equal to their maximum wounds they become incapacitated.\n\nAn
    incapacitated character gains one half their normal action points during their
    turn. If an incapacitated character takes an additional wound, they become unconscious.\n\nUnconscious
    characters are prone, helpless and unable to perform any actions and thus don\u2019t
    gain action points during their turn. If an unconscious character takes an additional
    wound they die.\n\n=\n\n\n\n### Stress\n\n-\n\nCharacters that get hit in combat
    are subject to psychological wounds. A character that is hit by an attack causes
    them to receive a Stress point even if that attack didn't deal any damage.\n\nWhen
    a character's total stress points exceed the character\u2019s willpower, the
    character becomes frightened and suffers from a hindrance to all actions. If
    a character\u2019s stress value exceeds their willpower twice, they become panicked.
    \n\nA panicked character must use their movement and actions during their turn
    to escape from danger, ideally by putting as much distance from them and any
    perceived threat or failing that finding the closest place in cover (ideally
    out of line of sight) and cowering there. If running away from where they are
    is immediately and obviously more dangerous than staying put, a panicking character
    will use their turn cowering instead.\n\nA panicked character can spend an action
    point at the start of their turn to avoid running away and instead freezing place.\n\n\n\n###
    Removing Stress\n\n-\n\nStress accumulates as a character survives hostile situations
    but there are a number of ways how a character can reduce their stress build
    up.\n\n- **Full Rest -** 1 stress point is automatically removed whenever a character
    sleeps.\n- **Meal -** Once per day a character can remove 1 stress from eating
    a meal if they are doing so in a safe and comfortable environment. Higher quality
    foods and drinks can further enhance this stress relieving effect.\n- **Leisure
    Time -** Characters can choose to spend their free time doing anything to take
    their minds off of things. For every hour of leisure time a chracter reduces
    1 stress point. \n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Injury & Infection\n\n-\n\nCharacters that
    have suffered from one or more wounds are considered to be injured and thus become
    susceptible to blood loss and infection.\n\n\n### Pain\nCharacters that have
    suffered from wounds in battle start suffering from pain. A character who has
    a number of wounds equal to half of their total suffers from a hindrance to all
    dice rolls. During their turn they may spend 1 action point to fight through
    the pain and ignore the penalty until the start of their next turn.\n\n### Blood
    Loss\nOne minute after that a character has suffered from a wound and for every
    minute thereafter a character gains 1 intensity of blood loss. As long as a character
    has 1 intensity of blood loss they suffer from a -1 penalty to initiative. If
    a character\u2019s blood loss intensity is equal to or greater than their vigour,
    the character falls unconscious. If a character\u2019s blood loss intensity is
    equal to or greater than twice their vigour, the character dies.\n\n### Infection\nOne
    hour after that a character has suffered from a wound and for every hour thereafter
    a character gains 1 intensity of infection. As long as a character has 1 intensity
    of infection they suffer from 1 point of injury penalty. This is in addition
    to any other injury penalty. For every time that the character\u2019s vigour
    is matched in infection intensity the injury penalty increases by 1. If a character\u2019s
    injury penalty is equal to or greater than their vigour, the character dies.\n\n###
    Healing\nCharacters that perform full rest in a comfortable shelter can heal
    wounds naturally. If a character\u2019s blood loss is stopped and their wounds
    are treated, a period of full rest will reduce the character\u2019s infection
    by 1. If a character no longer has infection, they instead remove 1 wound. Comfortable
    shelter requires a character to rest in dry and warm conditions.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n##
    Hazards\n\n-\n\n\n### Falling Damage\nCreatures that fall down from heights suffer
    impact damage based on the distance that they fell. This damage is an attack
    that automatically hits and does an amount of damage equal to 1 for every meter
    fell. This attack is a critical hit which means that for every time that the
    damage reaches the soak value an additional wound is inflicted. For example a
    character with a soak of 3 that suffers 7 damage will suffer from 2 wounds.\n\n###
    Damage from Falling Objects\nBig heavy objects crashing down on characters cause
    an amount of damage based on the debris weight. Unless a falling object is directly
    aimed towards a character, in which case it is treated as a normal ranged attack,
    falling objects around characters will allow potential targets to perform athletics
    dice rolls to dive out of the way. The normal difficulty is 6 allowing a character
    to dive 1m out of the way per margin of success and unspent movement points.
    If a character is hit, a falling object deals an amount of damage equal to its
    ENC +1 per meter that it fell. This attack is always considered a critical hit.\n\n###
    Extreme Temperatures\nCharacters that are navigating through terrain of extreme
    cold or extreme hot environs suffer from Hypothermia and Hyperthermia. In both
    cases a character will receive 1 intensity of the Extreme Temperature effect
    for every hour that they spend without shelter. Whenever this intensity equalizes
    with a character\u2019s Vigour their maximum stamina is reduced by 1. When a
    character\u2019s maximum stamina is reduced to 0 they fall unconscious. The next
    time the maximum stamina needs to be reduced they die. Maximum stamina loss is
    restored at a rate of 1 per full rest.\n\n### Starvation & Dehydration\nCharacters
    need to consume 1 meal per day minimum in order to survive. If they are unable
    to procure edible food and potable water they will suffer from Starvation & Dehydration.
    A character gains 1 intensity of Starvation every 24 hours and 1 intensity of
    Dehydration every 6 hours.Whenever this intensity equalizes with a character\u2019s
    Vigour their maximum stamina is reduced by 1. When a character\u2019s maximum
    stamina is reduced to 0 they fall unconscious. The next time the maximum stamina
    needs to be reduced they die. Maximum stamina loss is restored at a rate of 1
    per full rest.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n## Maladies\n\n-\n\n/\n\n\n\n### Poisons and Diseases\n\n-\n\nWhen
    a creature is afflicted by a type of malady, a poison, venom, toxin or disease,
    their Vigour comes into play. Each individual poison or disease comes with an
    intensity value. When a player is afflicted by a malady they gain a certain amount
    of intensity points in that malady. As long as the player has at least 1 or more
    intensity they count as being afflicted and thus suffer from the malady\u2019s
    effects. When the intensity of the malady increases to match or exceed the character\u2019s
    Vigour, the character starts suffering from a malady\u2019s acute effects. Certain
    maladies can be fatal or have effects that worsen depending on how many intensity
    points the malady reaches.\n\nThe following is an example of a malady:\n\n\n\n####
    Paralytic Poison\n\nnote(\nWhen a character is struck with an attack affected
    by paralytic poison they gain +1 intensity in Paralytic poison immediately and
    +1 intensity at the start of every turn thereafter for 2 minutes (20 rounds).\n\n\n**Mild
    Effect -** As long as a character has 1 or more intensity points in paralytic
    poison they suffer from a penalty to movement points gained per turn equal to
    -1 for every 2 intensity points in paralytic poison.\n\n**Acute Effect -** If
    a character has a number of intensity points in paralytic poison equal to or
    greater than their Vigour score, they are slowed. A slowed character must forego
    their main action or their bonus action at the beginning of their turn.\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n|\n\n\n\n###
    Curses and Hexes\n\n-\n\nCharacters that become cursed or are suffering from
    a hex are in essence beneath the crushing thumb of a sickness, one that affects
    their soul. Curses and hexes work exactly like Poisons and diseases and thus
    are considered to be maladies. Their only difference is that instead of combating
    them with Vigour a character combats them with Willpower.\n\nThe following is
    an example of a curse:\n\n\n\n#### Witch\u2019s Jinx\n\nnote(\nA character that
    performs any action that could cause harm to the witch gains +1 intensity in
    Witch\u2019s Jinx immediately and +1 intensity whenever they perform any action
    that may cause harm to the witch.\n\n\n**Mild Effect -** As long as a character
    has 1 or more intensity points in Witch\u2019s jinx they suffer from a hindrance
    to all dice rolls performed against the witch.\n\n**Acute Effect -** If a character
    has a number of intensity points in Witch\u2019s jinx equal to or greater than
    their Willpower score, any damage they inflict upon the Witch is also inflicted
    to them.\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n### Recovering from Maladies \n\n-\n\nEvery malady can
    be recovered from but the methods of recovery differ. Most diseases can be recovered
    with rest and nursing. For example a full rest period allows a character to reduce
    a disease\u2019 intensity by a value equal to their Vigour as long as they are
    well fed and resting comfortably. Poisons on the other hand require medical intervention.
    Immediate blood letting or applying of tourniquets for instance can stop a poison\u2019s
    intensity from worsening or at least slow it down from affecting the character
    every minute instead of every turn. Antidotes and detoxification needs to occur
    to remove the effect fully. Curses need to be removed by divine intervention,
    thus most people turn to members of the clergy or exorcists although folk magic
    and artisanal remedies are also said to work. In the case of most curses an intervention
    will remove a curse completely or halt it from progressing however certain powerful
    curses will require specific odd tasks to be performed in order to free the afflicted
    from the malady.\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n# Classes\n\n)\n-\n/\n\n\n# Bard\n\n-\n\nHailing

    never have more than one blessing at a time.\n\n#### Castigate [1AP]\nRoll a
    spellcasting dice roll against the target\u2019s Willpower. On a successful roll
    inflict an amount of Intensity of this curse equal to the margin of success:
    \nnote(\n#Divine Castigation Curse\n-\nAs long as a target has 1 or more intensity
    points, attacks performed against them are boosted. If the amount of intensity
    points matches or exceeds the target\u2019s willpower they suffer from a -1 penalty
    to Defence.\n)\n\n#### Heal [1 Focus]\nTarget one creature within 10m to benefit
    from Heal. When a creature receives heal choose one of the following effects:\n-
    **Cure -** Restore 1 wound.\n- **Ward -** Reduce the intensity of a curse or
    hex by 2.\n\n#### Intervention [1 Focus]\nUntil the start of the next turn during
    another character\u2019s turn after the character has performed a dice roll,
    you can decide to change the result of the die to 2 or 9. This can be done up
    to three times per turn but each target can be cursed only once per turn. Roll
    a spellcasting dice roll against the target\u2019s Willpower.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n#
    Dervish\n\n-\n\nOriginally an art hailing from the lands of levanta, the blade
    dancing dervishes and their true origins are a contentious subject. Both orcs
    and goblinoids equally claim to be the inventors of the art of sword dancing
    and wielding two weapons effectively. Because the art\u2019s roots predate the
    demonic invasion and the subsequent enslavement of the orcs and goblins it is
    anybody\u2019s guess who really invented the art, but it is undeniable in its
    beauty and ferociousness.\n\n\n#### Blade Dance [3 Initiative]\nActivating blade
    dance grants the user the effects of Parry.\n\n#### Ambidexterity [1AP]\nUntil
    the start of your next turn you gain an attack with your off hand weapon for
    every attack performed with your main hand weapon.\n\n#### Riposte [1AP]\nWhen
    an enemy attack fails to hit you spend an action point to immediately perform
    a close combat attack followed by any one maneuver against that opponent.\n\n####
    Combat Expertise [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of your next turn gain a bonus
    to defence equal to the amount of attacks performed this turn.\n\n#### Whirlwind
    Attack [1 Stamina and 1AP]\nPerform one attack against all targets within your
    weapon\u2019s range.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n# Duellist\n\n-\n\nIn the late imperial
    age a number of mercenary companies had eventually developed into fully fledged
    low aristocratic houses each guarding jealously decades if not centuries of accumulated
    martial knowledge. These advanced and unique martial arts had created a unique
    class of fighter, a skirmisher capable of holding their own in small numbers
    and working outside of a normal military structure.\n\n\n#### Expertise [5 Movement
    Points]\nWhen rolling initiative gain a +2 bonus to Initiative. This causes you
    to receive 5 movement points less than normal if you spend action points on movement.\n\n####
    Trick [1AP]\nAdd any one of the following effects to your strike. \n Slash, Pierce,
    Maim, Push. \n Add two effects if the target's initiative is lower than yours.\n\n####
    Quick [1AP]\nUntil the start of your next turn you may perform an extra attack
    with the same weapon against the same target immediately after resolving the
    first attack.\n\n#### Dashing [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of the next turn gain
    a modifier to your attack dice roll equal to the difference in initiative between
    you and your target.\n\n#### Dazzling [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of the next
    turn gain a bonus to Defence equal to the difference in initiative between you
    and your attacker.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Druid\n\n-\n\nThose who are gifted in the
    voice haven't always sought the power of divine pantheons and have instead turned
    their ear to the primordial primal forces of nature. Shamans, mystics and feral
    mages of all ilks used to roam the lands in the era of the tribes and all of
    their ways have coalesced into what is nowadays known as the Druid. The feral
    divine arts are a loose collection of spiritual traditions and superstitious
    heritages that came together to create the way of nature\u2019s guardian.\n\n\n####
    Beast Aspect [3 Initiative]\nGain one of the following: \n**Wings -** Gain the
    ability to fly. \n**Fangs & Claws -** Gain +1 damage on unarmed close combat

    turn.\n\n\n#### Geomancy [1AP]\nAlter an area of terrain of 4mx4m (or any combination
    of 16 1mx1m squares). The terrain is turned into mud, sand, solid rock, shallow
    water or ice until the start of your next turn when it goes back to normal. Characters
    standing in or moving through this terrain are hindered and it counts as rough
    terrain.\n\n#### Master of the Wilds [1 Focus]\nUntil the end of the encounter
    you or another allied creature within 10m of you benefit from the effects of
    animal form. In addition to the normal beast aspects, you can now choose from
    the following list as well. \n**Snapjaw -** Close combat attacks benefit from
    pierce, maim and slash. \n**Venom -** Wounded targets that survive that attack
    are poisoned. Poisoned characters are hindered when performing dice rolls. \n**Regenerate
    -** Spend a main action to restore 1 lost wound point.\n\n#### Terraforming [1
    Focus]\nPerform a geomancy effect that is permanent.\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n# Elementalist\n\n-\n\nThe
    first flame is legendarily attributed to have been created by Galstaff of the
    Meridian shamans. While actual evidence is hard to come by from such ancient
    times it is clear that elemental magic was originally known by its first name,
    i.e. \u201CMagic\u201D. The ways of manipulating the elements have followed civilization
    from the very start and are greatly attributed to be the pillar of power that
    allowed the empire to form.\n\n\n#### Levitate [3 Initiative]\nDuring this turn
    you may fly at a distance of 1m per 2 movement points spent.\n\n#### Blast [1AP]\nMake
    a spellcasting attack against a target\u2019s Willpower within 20m that deals
    +2 damage. An attack that hits, inflicts an amount of fire, cold or shock tokens
    on the target equal to the dice roll\u2019s margin. If the amount of tokens is
    equal to or greater than the target\u2019s soak, they suffer from the token\u2019s
    effect. \n**Fire -** A creature that is burning suffers 1 wound and gains an
    additional fire token at the end of its turn. \n**Cold -** A creature that is
    freezing suffers from a -1 penalty to movement points for every cold token and
    as long as they have at least 1 cold token they suffer from -1 to action points.
    \n**Shock -** A creature that is electrocuted suffers from a hindrance to all
    dice rolls. \nA creature can spend 1AP to reduce 1 token for each action point
    spent.\n\n#### Counter [1AP]\nNullify the casting of a spell within 20m of you.
    Roll a spellcasting dice roll against the target\u2019s Willpower.\n\n#### Explosion
    [1 Focus]\nChoose a 4x4 area fully within 20m of you or draw a straight line
    from yourself up to 20m away. All targets within this area are hit with a Blast
    of your choice.\n\n#### Elemental Control [1 Focus]\nUntil the end of the encounter
    during your turn choose any 3 targets that currently have fire, cold, or shock
    tokens (or natural sources of heat, cold or electricity), roll a spellcasting
    dice roll against the target\u2019s Willpower and do any of the following. \nAlter
    - Double or half the amount of tokens on the target. Halfing 1 token removes
    it completely. \nSwap - Swap the tokens that two or more chosen targets have
    on them with each other.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Knight\n\n-\n\nThe chivalric code
    has existed for as long as there were lords wealthy enough to pay for their armed
    house warriors. Knights are more than mere highly paid and equipped brutes. Either
    born of noble stock or commoners elevated to a higher societal position, the
    knight is a sworn champion in service of their king or emperor, a defender of
    the lands and the interests of their banners.\n\n\n#### Bulwark [3 Initiative]\nGain
    a +1 bonus on Soak if you are currently wearing armour or holding a shield.\n\n####
    Guard [1AP]\nUntil the start of the next turn when an enemy character walks within
    range of your weapon, immediately perform an attack against that enemy.\n\n####
    Defend [1AP]\nGrant the effect of the Protect maneuvre to all allies within range
    instead of just one.\n\n#### Weapon Master [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of the
    next turn when performing a close combat attack you may confer any of the following
    effects to your blow. Push, Slam, Maim, Pierce.  A character can spend 1 extra
    action point in order to confer three effects instead of one.\n\n#### Cleave
    [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of the next turn when performing a close combat
    attack, choose an additional two targets beyond the first. All targets are affected
    the same and must be within the weapon\u2019s range.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n# Monk\n\n-\n\nAncient
    arts as old as Orienta itself the ways of the warrior monks have travelled westward
    and propagated throughout the lands as a storm. The magnificent displays of athleticism
    and superhuman dexterity had often captured the imaginations of foreigners that
    witnessed them but monks and their monasteries were never a monolith that aligned
    themself with any one faction or nation. Those lucky enough to have monks among
    their allies had a rare privilege.\n\n\n#### Technique [3 Initiative]\nGain any
    1 of the following:\nDouble the amount of movement points gained.\nGain +1 AP.\n\n####
    Kata [1AP]\nUntil the start of the next turn whenever performing an unarmed attack
    that hits a target, you may immediately perform a close combat maneuver against
    the same target.\n\n#### Jutsu [1AP]\nUntil the start of the next turn while
    unarmoured you gain the benefit of parry against a number of attacks equal to
    your close combat modifier x2.\n\n#### Counter [1 Stamina]\nUntil the end of
    the encounter whenever an enemy performs an attack that doesn\u2019t hit you,
    you may immediately perform an unarmed attack against them.\n\n#### Flurry of
    Blows [1 Stamina]\nUntil the end of the encounter while unarmed, perform two
    unarmed attacks for each attack point spent.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Necromancer\n\n-\n\nOne
    of the most ancient forms of arcane study is the study of death and the dying.
    Although initially banned by the empire it was clear that the utility and demand
    for the services of necromancers was too high and after decades of the nobility
    and aristocracy secretly employing and funding necromantic studies, it became
    a highly regulated practice and area of study with the talents of necromancers
    used in a variety of applications within imperial life.\n\n/\n\n\n#### Detect
    Life [3 Initiative]\nDuring this turn you may see the outline of living things
    through solid objects at a range equal to half your perception range.\n\n####
    Corpse Explosion [1AP]\nMake a spellcasting dice roll against a target corpse\u2019s
    Willpower within 10m. If the dice roll is successful the target corpse explodes
    causing damage to its surroundings. The blast has an intensity value equal to
    the caster\u2019s spellcasting skill modifier. The blasts\u2019s attack dice
    roll bonus is equal to the intensity and its splash area is equal to the intensity
    x2m. If the corpse occupies a large space, extend the splash from outside the
    corpse\u2019s base area.\n\n#### Undead Servant [1AP]\nThis spell\u2019s effects
    last until the end of the turn or until the undead servant dies. An undead servant
    has a power level equal to their summoner\u2019s spellcasting skill modifier.
    The servant\u2019s stats are as follows: \n*Defence [4+PL], Soak [PL], Vigour
    [4+PL], Willpower [4+PL], Perception Range [PL x20m], Movement Points [PL x2],
    Carrying Capacity  [PL x2], Max Wounds [PL], Action Points [PL]* \n\nAdditionally
    a necromancer can choose any one of the following features: \n- **Ghoul -** When
    this creature causes damage with their close combat attacks, they restore 1 wound.
    \n- **Wraith -** This creature gains a 20m ranged attack that causes +1 damage
    and inflicts 2 stress points on successful hits. \n- **Zombie -** This creature
    gains 2 extra wounds. \n- **Skeleton -** This creature gains +2 soak against
    piercing attacks and is immune to the piercing effect. \n\nIf an undead servant
    is destroyed the necromancer must perform a short rest before being able to summon
    them again.  \n|\n\n#### Rise [1 Focus]\nMake a spellcasting dice roll against
    a target corpse\u2019s willpower within 10m. If the dice roll is successful the
    target corpse rises as an undead servant. Undead servants have an initiative
    score equal to their controller and will last until the end of the encounter
    or until their controller dismisses them or dies. An undead servant returns with
    all of its wounds repaired but any lost limbs are not recovered. A necromancer
    can only have an amount of undead servants at any one time equal to their spell
    casting skill modifier. Once a servant is dismissed the corpse is destroyed.\n\n####
    Memento Mori [Main]\nCast this spell against a target living creature\u2019s
    willpower within 20m. The creature receives a memento mori mark with an intensity
    equal to the margin of success which allows the caster to inflict a number of
    stress points on the creature equal to the intensity once per turn. If the creature\u2019s
    stress is equal to or greater than the target\u2019s willpower, they suffer from
    a wound.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Ranger\n\n-\n\nBefore there were kingdoms, or cities,
    or villages or tribes there was the hunter. The ranger was not invented, they
    changed and adapted with the times leaving behind a civilization that desperately
    tried to keep up. Those who shunned the comforts of modernity and the safety
    of walls have embraced the wilds and became part of them. Even when the civilizations
    of the world were at their highest the rangers were still needed. Now they are
    needed more than ever.\n\n\n#### Relocate [3 Initiative]\nGain 2 Movement Points
    whenever performing an attack that deals damage.\n\n#### Weave [1AP]\nImmediately
    gain Athletics x2 movement points. Gain a bonus to defence equal to +1 for every

    lasts until the start of the next turn.\n\n#### Momentum [1AP]\nImmediately gain
    Athletics x2 movement points. Gain a bonus to attack damage equal to +1 for every
    3 movement points used this turn. This bonus lasts until the start of the next
    turn.\n\n#### Hail of Arrows [1 Stamina and 1AP]\nCombat stance is activated.
    until the start of your next turn, for every shot fired with your ranged weapon,
    you may fire an additional shot as part of the same action.\n\n#### Flurry of
    Blades [1 Stamina]\nUntil the start of the next turn. Gain 1 action point for
    every enemy killed or knocked out. The maximum action points that a character
    can gain this way within a turn is equal to the amount of action points that
    they start with at the beginning of the turn.\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n# Rogue\n\n-\n\nAs
    long as there are two people alive, someone will want someone dead. Thieves,
    assassins, spies and charlatans, the rogue\u2019s origins are inevitably tied
    to the lower classes of society, the shadows which hide the illicit from unassuming
    eyes. Despite this the services of the covert and the inconspicuous have always
    found plenty of use in the highest courts of nobility and the aristocrats who
    often look down upon the furtive, have called upon their services far more that
    they\u2019d like to admit.\n\n\n#### Sneak [Initiative]\nCharacter may perform
    a hide action by spending a bonus action or 3 movement points.\n\n#### Infiltrator
    [Bonus]\nWhen performing actions while hidden, spend a bonus action to reduce
    all penalties to stealth score by 1.\n\n#### Ambush [Bonus]\nWhen making an attack
    against a surprised opponent you may spend a bonus action to gain a number of
    attack points equal to their stealth skill modifier.\n\n#### Assassin [Main]\nSpend
    1 Stamina to activate this talent. This talent lasts until the start of the next

    perception score. This bonus can only be applied against surprised targets.\n\n####
    Ghost [Main]\nSpend 1 Stamina to activate this talent. This talent lasts until
    the start of the next turn. Whenever using any main action or bonus action you
    may also hide into stealth for free.\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n# Samurai\n\n-\n\nOriginally
    hailing from Orienta the way of the samurai is as much an immigrant as the warrior
    bureaucrats that brought the art with them. Samurai are honourable servants of
    their Daimyo and Shogun masters, sworn to a lifetime of service. The Samurai
    that travel outside of Orienta were ambassadors and diplomats, often sent on
    missions to discover trade and alliance partners abroad all the while keeping
    a watchful eye on the ever expanding empire.\n\n/\n\n\n#### Iaido [Initiative]\nWhen
    rolling initiative, gain a +2 bonus on initiative dice rolls. This causes you
    to receive 3 movement points less than normal.\n\n#### Kiai [Bonus]\nWhen causing
    damage with an attack, spend your bonus action. All enemies within 5m of your
    target receive a number of stress points equal to the damage caused by the attack.\n\n####
    Kyudo [Bonus]\nWhen spending a bonus action to take aim with your ranged attack,
    your ranged attack gets boosted in addition to the aim bonus and the bonus affects
    all ranged attacks during your turn and not just the next one.\n\n#### Bushido
    [Main]\nSpend 1 Stamina to activate this talent. This talent lasts until the
    start of the next turn. When performing multiple attacks against the same target,
    gain a cumulative +1 bonus to attack dice rolls for every attack beyond the first.\n\n####
    Yumihiki [Main]\nSpend 1 Stamina to activate this talent. This talent lasts until
    the start of the next turn. When performing a ranged attack you may confer any
    1 of the following effects to your shots. Slash, Push, Slam, Maim. A character
    can spend 1 attack point in order to confer three effects instead of one.\n\n\n\n|\n\n=\n\n\n\n#
    Tenebrist\n\n-\n\nOriginally Tenebral magic was attributed to the forces of the
    demon lords in their invasion. In reality tenebrothurgy was originally created
    by the Levantese, an arcane art that was stolen by the forces of the demon realm.
    Tenebral art resurged with the expansion of the horde and reached the empire
    when travellers learned in the obscure art reached imperial borders. Even so
    all the way to the end little was ever known or discovered about tenebrists and
    their shadow dancing.\n\n/\n\n\n#### Shadow leap [Initiative]\nWhen rolling initiative
    cast this spell. You must be standing within an obscured area. Choose another
    obscured area within range equal to your spellcasting skill modifier x10m and
    appear there. This action can be used while hiding without penalty.\n\n#### Dark
    Cloak [Bonus]\nSpend a bonus action to activate this spell. This spell lasts
    until the start of the next turn. The cloak gains an intensity equal to your
    spellcasting spell modifier. For each intensity value you can gain one or more

    per intensity spent.\n\n#### Tendrils [Bonus]\nSpend a bonus action to activate
    this spell. The spell lasts until the start of the next turn. Choose an amount
    of square meters within 20m of you equal to your spellcasting skill modifier
    x2. Targets that start their turn, end their turn or move into these squares
    become entangled. Entangled targets must sacrifice their main action to become
    free or else they lose all of their movement points.\n|\n\n#### Portals [Main]\nSpend
    1 Focus point to activate this spell with an intensity equal to your spellcasting
    skill modifier. This spell remains active until the end of the encounter. Choose
    any two solid surfaces completely within 20m x intensity of you to project two
    connected portals, each of which can be up to 2 x intensity square meters in
    size. During your turn you can spend a bonus action or 3 movement points to move
    the Portals to new locations.\n\n#### Displacement [Main]\nSpend 1 Focus point
    to activate this spell. The spell lasts until the end of the encounter or until
    it is dismissed. This spell has an intensity equal to your spellcasting modifier.
    For each intensity value you can gain any one or more of the following abilities:
    Intangibility - Intangible creatures cannot manipulate the world or be manipulated
    becoming immune to physical damage and able to pass through solid matter but
    becoming themselves unable to cause physical damage. Magical attacks and spells
    still work as normal. Invisibility - Invisible creatures cannot be seen and thus
    have a permanent hidden state with a bonus to stealth equal to the spell\u2019s
    intensity. Inscrutability - Inscrutable creatures can ignore solid obstacles
    when attacking allowing them to ignore armour. During your initiative you can
    choose which of the abilities to activate and deactivate. \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nhead(\n#
    Rituals\n\n)\n-\nRituals are magical spells that characters that are trained
    in the spellcasting skill can learn and use. Unlike talents which require specialised
    training and intense concentration, rituals are slow and simple procedures that
    can be practiced and learned by most people who can learn the basics of spellcasting.\n/\n\n\n##
    Learning Rituals\n\n-\n\n/\n\nA character needs to learn a ritual, adding it
    to their repertoire in order to start using it. When learning a new ritual a
    character has two options, either follow the instructions from a book or other
    source of knowledge, or else be taught the ritual by someone who already knows
    it. Each ritual has a rarity rating which determines its complexity as follows:\n\n-
    **Common -** Rituals have a Complexity of 5\n- **Uncommon -** Rituals have a
    Complexity of 10\n- **Rare -** Rituals have a Complexity of 15\n- **Legendary
    -** Rituals have a Complexity of 20\n\n\n|\n\nIn order for a character to learn
    a ritual they must spend practice sessions that take 2 hours and allow them to
    perform a spellcasting dice roll. If the character is learning the ritual from
    a source, the difficulty is 8. If the character is learning the ritual from a
    mentor, the difficulty is 6. The margin of success of this dice roll is added
    towards a progress value. When the progress value is equal to the complexity
    of the Ritual, the character has successfully learned it.\n\n/\n\n\n\n## Rituals\n\n\nnote(\n#Ritual

    is the one and only lifeline for any survivor.\n/\n\n\n## Carrying Capacity\n\nCharacters
    are capable of carrying an amount of equipment in encumbrance points (ENC) based
    on their Conditioning skill. The total carrying capacity is equal to 5 + conditioning
    skill modifier x3. If a character\u2019s total carried weight is less than the
    carrying capacity the character is unencumbered and may move around as normal.
    If a character\u2019s total carried weight is equal to or greater than their
    carried weight they are considered to be encumbered and thus become immobile
    and cannot receive movement points.\n\n\n\n#### Close Combat Weapons\n\nName

    Professional Tool Kit\n\nEvery profession that needs handiwork has a specific
    set of tools of the trade without which performing said trade would be impossible.
    Characters that wish to craft, repair, maintain, upgrade or scavenge items needs
    to have the correct tool kit:\n\n- **Blacksmith\u2019s tools -** This set of
    metalworking implements lets a character maintain hardware.\n- **Carpenter\u2019s
    tools -** From fixing roofs, to building chairs to fletching arrows, carpenter\u2019s
    tools are always handy.\n- **Leatherworker\u2019s tools -** This handy kit lets
    a character do the whole process from skinning a felled beast to drying the hide
    all the way to shaping and cutting the leather.\n- **Tailor\u2019s tools -**
    Anything that is needed to fix and reinforce fabric if not reshape it into something
    pleasing to the eye.\n- **Enchanter\u2019s tools -** From the making of talismans,
    to the crafting of runes, to the scribing of scrolls the Enchanter\u2019s toolkit
    lets the magically adept create wondrous items.\n- **Alchemical tools -** Brewers
    of potions and mixers of explosives alike need Alchemical tools to concoct their
    deadly solutions.\n- **First Aid kit -** This small pouch contains a collection
    of reusable bandages, tourniquets, clips, pincers, scissors and dressings along
    with some cleaning alcohol to act as a simple disinfectant or sterilizer.\n-
    **Brewer\u2019s Set -** This set of pots, containers, canisters, tubes and vials
    is designed to allow the precise measuring and mixing of components. A character
    using a brewer\u2019s set may craft brewed solutions.\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Grandmaster
    Tool Kit\n\nGrandmaster tools are a higher grade than mere professional kits
    that are made with better parts, have a wider variety of bits and offer the wielder
    a vast range of possibilities. A character wielding a set of grandmaster tools
    gains a boost on any related dice roll. The same categories as Professional tool
    kits is available for Grandmaster ones with the following additions:\n\n- **Wayfaring
    Kit -** Often containing sextants, telescopes, compasses, whistles and updated
    maps these kits also allow the user to quickly modify and update their maps and
    plot out long routes. Characters using wayfaring kits gain a boost to any navigation
    related dice roll.\n- **Surgeon\u2019s Tools -** A collection of blades, saws,
    probes and trays along with esoteric and exotic tubing and valves, all designed
    to perform deep interventions within a patient\u2019s body. In addition to allowing
    the use of First Aid & Treat Wounds this tool grants a boost to any related dice
    roll.\n- **Trapper\u2019s Kit -** This kit is made out of a number of small snares
    and traps designed to entangle and entrap small game. The Snares are reusable
    for the most part and provide a character with a reliable solution to capture
    small creatures effectively. Characters that use this kit gain a boost on their
    small game hunting action dice rolls.\n- **Herbalist's Sickles -** This set of
    sharp gardening blades allows an adept herbalist at extracting and stripping
    plants efficiently granting them with a boost on dice rolls performed to gather
    components.\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n### Grapple Hook and Rope\n\nA well honed hook and
    rope can turn an impossible or dangerous climb into a fairly reasonable task,
    as long as you can hook the grapple correctly to somewhere safe. A character
    must pass an athletics or ranged combat dice roll against a difficulty of 6 in
    order to throw and hook the grapple correctly against a safe landing. Once hooked
    the rope reduces the amount of movement points spent on every 1m of climbing
    by 1 (minimum 1).\n\n\n\n### Big Game Trap \n\nThis large heavy metal trap is
    designed to not only injure a creature but also hamstring it. Creatures that
    fall afoul of this trap suffer from a damage 4 attack that hits with a margin
    of 0. If the attack injures the target, in addition to the wound the target is
    also tangled.\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Component Canister\n\nThis pressurised vessel is
    designed to keep the unstable reactive materials that are mixed into solutions,
    safe and stable until use. A canister can store up to 10 components for 1 month
    before they decay.\n\n\n\n### Pressure Cooker\n\nThis fully sealed hyperbaric
    chamber allows a herbalist to swiftly mix up concoctions within a high pressure
    environment. This tool allows the brewer to craft solutions in 5 minutes.\n\n=\n\n\n\n####
    Armour\n\nCharacters can wear suits of armour to protect themselves from harm
    during hostile situations. \n\n\n### Armour Value (ARM)\nWhenever a character
    suffers from any damage the armour\u2019s ARM value comes into play by adding
    to the Soak to reduce the damage.\n\n### Durability Value (DUR)\nWhen a character
    is hit with a wound they have the option to take the damage on their equipment
    instead of on their body. Every armour has a Durability (DUR) value which determines
    how many wounds worth of damage the armour can take for their wearer. DUR is
    restored through a repair action, with one repair action restoring one DUR.\n\n\n\nName

    can wear gear items in order to bolster their carrying capacity or gain different
    effects. Every gear item occupies a \u2018slot\u2019 on the character\u2019s
    body and a character can only ever benefit from one item on any given slot.\n\nName

    items offer short temporary boosts, or useful cures from a number of ailments.
    Because a lot of alchemical solutions tend to be dangerous if taken without moderation,
    some items increase toxicity in a character\u2019s body.\n\n- **Toxicity -**
    A character that consumes solutions suffers from a number of toxicity points
    for each solution consumed. If a character\u2019s toxicity value is equal to
    or greater than the character\u2019s vigour, the character falls unconscious
    until the toxicity value is reduced. A character that receives a full rest reduces
    their toxicity by 1.\n\n\nName | Toxicity | ENC | Cost | Rarity | Traits \n--

    filling meal rich in substance and flavour, made with choice ingredients and
    a helping of the chef's love. A character that consumes this meal will double
    the amount of Stamina restored with their next full rest.\n\n\n\n### Soothing
    Meal\n\nA pleasing, intense and flavourful meal that is a feast for the eyes
    and the stomach alike. A character that consumes this meal will double the amount
    of Focus restored with their next full rest.\n\n\n\n### Healthy Meal\n\nA robust
    helping of ingredients that are needed for a recovering individual. A character
    that consumes this meal will double the amount of Bleeding, Infection, Disease
    or Poison intensity removed with their next full rest.\n\n\n\n### Satisfying
    Meal\n\nA full and heavy flavourful meal rich in fats and flavour. A character
    that consumes this meal will double the amount of Stress removed with their next
    full rest.\n\n\n\n### Antibiotic Infusion\n\nThis foul tasting concoction is
    commonly transported in small vials or pressed into swallowable pellets. Consuming
    one such infusion slows down the spread of infection to double the normal time
    it would otherwise take to increase in intensity.\n\n\n\n### Travelling Ration\n\nCommon
    travelling rations are a collection of nuts, fruits and mushrooms that have been
    dried in order to extend their longevity. A character can survive off of one
    ration daily and a ration will keep for a whole month before going bad and becoming
    completely inedible.\n\n|\n\n\n\n### Toxin Coating\n\nToxin coatings are poured
    over weapons in order to impart harmful effects on targets. Applying a toxin
    coating on a weapon is a bonus action. A weapon that is coated with a toxin will
    impart its effect on the weapon\u2019s next attack after which the coating\u2019s
    effect is lost. A weapon can only ever have one coating on it, the last one that
    it received.  A coating has an intensity value that is used to determine how
    strong its effect is. A coating will inflict a number of toxin effects on a target
    equal to the coating\u2019s intensity value.\n\n- **Deprivation [X] -** Targets
    suffer from a penalty to initiative equal to X.\n- **Enervation [X] -** Targets
    suffer from a hindrance to all actions. If X equal to or greater than the target\u2019s
    vigour, the target suffers from a -1 penalty to all close combat damage.\n- **Paralysis
    [X] -** Targets suffer from a penalty to movement points equal to X. If X is
    equal to or greater than the target\u2019s vigour, the target is slowed. A slowed
    target must choose to not receive their movement points, bonus action or main
    action at the start of their turn.\n\n\n\n\n### Armour Coating\n\nArmour coatings
    are special oils poured and smeared over armour and gear in order to impart beneficial
    and protective effects on the wearer and the item. An armour that is coated will
    retain its beneficial effects until the effects are depleted, the item is cleaned
    or a new coating is added on top of the old one. Any item can only ever benefit
    from one coating at a time.\n\n- **Fire Retardant -** The wearer of an armour
    treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points of fire intensity that
    they receive after which the coating is removed.\n- **Anti-Freeze -** Character
    gainsThe wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first
    3 points of cold intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.
    a number of bonus movement points per turn equal to X.\n- **Grounding -** The
    wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first 3 points
    of shock intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n- **Lubricant
    -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove the first 3
    points of tangle intensity that they receive after which the coating is removed.\n-
    **Alkalene -** The wearer of an armour treated with this coating will remove
    the first 3 points of corrosion intensity that they receive after which the coating
    is removed.\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n### Reagent Salve\n\nA reagent salve is designed to
    aid the body to heal. Salves are consumed by characters as bonus action and each
    salve that a character consumes causes the character to receive 1 point of toxicity.
    An alchemist\u2019s salve has an intensity value that is used to determine how
    strong its effect is. A salve can have any one of the following effects:\n\n-
    **Coagulation [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s blood loss intensity by
    an amount equal to X\n- **Cleansing [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s
    infection intensity by an amount equal to X.\n- **Purification [X] -** Reduce
    a target character\u2019s poison intensity by an amount equal to X.\n- **Fortification
    [X] -** Reduce a target character\u2019s disease intensity by an amount equal
    to X.\n\n\n\n\n### Mutagenic Elixir\n\nA mutagenic elixir is a body booster that
    grants a character a temporary enhancement on their natural ability. Elixirs
    are consumed by characters as bonus actions and each elixir that a character
    consumes causes the character to receive 3 points of toxicity. An elixir\u2019s
    effect lasts until the character performs a full rest. An elixir has an intensity
    value that is used to determine how strong its effect is. An elixir can have
    any one of the following effects:\n\n- **Awareness [X] -** Character gains a
    boost to perception dice rolls and  a +10% bonus to perception range per X.\n-
    **Speed [X] -** Character gains a number of bonus movement points per turn equal
    to X.\n- **Haste [X] -** Character gains a number of haste tokens equal to X.
    The character may spend one haste token at the start of a turn in order to gain
    an additional bonus action. Any unspent haste tokens are lost if a character
    rests.\n- **Might [X] -** Character gains a number of might tokens equal to X.
    The character may spend one might token at the start of a turn in order to gain
    a +1 bonus to close combat attack damage. Any unspent might tokens are lost if
    a character rests.\n- **Endurance [X] -** Character gains a bonus to carrying
    capacity equal to X.\n- **Alertness [X] -** Character gains a bonus to initiative
    equal to X.\n- **Reinvigoration -** Character removes 1 stress.\n- **Regeneration
    -** Character restores 1 wound.\n- **Rejuvenation -** Character restores 1 stamina.\n-
    **Revitalization -** Character restores 1 focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n##Traits\n-\n/\n###Batch
